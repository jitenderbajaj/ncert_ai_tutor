Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution.

Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power.
