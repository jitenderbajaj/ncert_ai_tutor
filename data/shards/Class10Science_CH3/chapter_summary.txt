Metals and non-metals are classified based on their physical properties, such as malleability, conductivity, sonorousness, and density. Metals exhibit physical properties like being good conductors of heat, having high melting points, and producing a sound when struck against a hard surface, whereas non-metals do not display these characteristics. The reactivity of metals with oxygen, water, and acids is also distinct, with some metals burning easily in air, while others react violently or not at all. Metals can displace less reactive metals from their compounds in solution or molten form, indicating a difference in reactivity. The electronic configuration of elements explains the tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell, leading to the formation of ionic compounds through the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal. These compounds exhibit properties like being insoluble in water, having high melting and boiling points, and forming ions with opposite charges that attract each other due to electrostatic forces of attraction.
