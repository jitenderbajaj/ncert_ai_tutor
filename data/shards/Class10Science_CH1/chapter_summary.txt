Chemical reactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to produce new substances, where chemical equations can be represented using chemical formulae instead of words, resulting in a concise and useful representation. A balanced chemical equation is essential as it ensures that the number of atoms of each element remains the same before and after the reaction, adhering to the law of conservation of mass. Writing a chemical equation involves drawing boxes around each formula, listing the number of atoms present in reactants and products, balancing the equation by adding coefficients, and finally checking the correctness of the balanced equation. Physical states of reactants and products can be represented using symbols such as (g), (l), (aq), and (s) to make the chemical equation more informative. Types of chemical reactions include combination reactions where two or more substances combine to form a single product, displacement reactions where one element displaces another from its compound, and double displacement reactions where two compounds exchange partners. Oxidation occurs when a substance gains oxygen or loses hydrogen, while reduction occurs when a substance loses oxygen or gains hydrogen during a reaction.
