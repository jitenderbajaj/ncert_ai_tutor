If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations. a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\n    User Question: \"What are the key properties and behavior of substances in Chemistry?\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.

Acids are substances that donate hydrogen ions (H+), while bases accept hydrogen ions or release hydroxide ions (OH-). The concentration of these ions determines the pH scale, which ranges from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline).\n\nAcids are characterized by their ability to conduct electricity and change the color of litmus paper from blue to red. Bases, on the other hand, are known for their ability to neutralize acids and change the color of litmus paper from red to blue.\n\nThe behavior of acids and bases is crucial in various chemical reactions, such as neutralization reactions, where they cancel out each other's effects. Understanding the properties and behavior of acids and bases is essential for chemists to predict and control chemical reactions.\n\nWould you like to explore this topic further?", "duration_ms": 4634, "error": null}

If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nSince the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties. Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution? Do acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this. Activity, what do\nyou infer about the acidic character of:\n(i)\ndry HCl gas\n(ii)\nHCl solution? a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Preparation of HCl gas\nThis experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced\nin the presence of water. The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water. HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+). H+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water. Let us see\nwhat happens when a base is dissolved in water. NaOH(s)\nH O\n\n\n→\n Na+ (aq) + OH– (aq)\nNote to teachers: If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced\nthrough a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.

Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis. Do You\nKnow? All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis? Now as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\n–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows –\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nH X + M OH → MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\n– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\n\nThus, the reaction of a metal with an acid can be summarised as –\nAcid + Metal → Salt + Hydrogen gas\nCan you now write the equations for the reactions you have observed?

The reaction taking place is written as –\nNaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\nThe reaction between an acid and a base to give a salt and water is\nknown as a neutralisation reaction. In general, a neutralisation reaction\ncan be written as –\nBase + Acid → Salt + Water\n2.1.5 Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids\n\n\nScience\n\nNow write and balance the equation for the above reaction. Since\nmetallic oxides react with acids to give salts and water, similar to the\nreaction of a base with an acid, metallic oxides are said to be basic oxides. 2.1.6 Reaction of a Non-metallic Oxide with Base\nYou saw the reaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide\n(lime water) in Activity to\ninvestigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic.

Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions.

In everyday life, we often associate acids with sour tastes and bitter sensations, while bases are linked to soapy textures and a tendency to corrode metal surfaces.\n\nHowever, chemically speaking, an acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+), denoted by its chemical formula as H+(aq). When these hydrogen ions combine with water molecules, they form hydronium ions (H3O+, also known as hydronium or simply H+ in aqueous solutions), which are responsible for the acidic properties.\n\nOn the other hand, a base is a substance that increases the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH–), represented by its chemical formula as OH–. In water, these hydroxide ions combine with hydrogen atoms to form hydronium ions, leading to the basic nature of the substance.\n\n**The Neutralisation Reaction**\n\nWhen an acid and a base react, they cancel each other out's effects. This process is known as neutralization or neutralisation reaction. The general equation for this reaction can be expressed as:\nBase + Acid → Salt + Water\n\nIn this context, let's take a closer look at the chemical formula HX (where X represents an element) and its interaction with water. When we add hydrogen ions (H+) from an acid to hydroxide ions (OH–) from a base, they combine to form water molecules (H2O), leading to the cancellation of their respective acidic or basic effects.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTo answer your original question regarding remedies for acidity after overeating, it's essential to consider the properties of acids and bases. In this scenario, lemon juice, vinegar, and baking soda solution are options. However, when choosing a remedy, we must think about which property would be beneficial: neutralizing acidic effects or counteracting basic ones.\n\nBased on our understanding of acids and bases, if someone in your family is experiencing acidity after overeating, you could suggest drinking water to help dilute the stomach acid. If the issue persists, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) might provide relief by neutralizing excess hydrogen ions (H+). However, it's crucial to avoid using lemon juice or vinegar directly, as they may worsen the situation.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like to explore any of these concepts further!", "duration_ms": 6878, "error": null}

When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nSince the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties. Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution?

Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\n    User Question: \"What are the fundamental properties and reactions of Acids and Bases in a Laboratory Setting?\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.

In a laboratory setting, understanding these properties and reactions is crucial for various chemical experiments and processes.\n\nOne fundamental property of acids is their ability to donate hydrogen ions (H+), which are responsible for their acidic nature. This is evident in the reaction between an acid like HCl and water, resulting in the formation of hydrogen gas (H2) and chloride ions (Cl-).\n\nOn the other hand, bases exhibit the opposite behavior by accepting hydrogen ions, thus becoming alkaline or basic. The reaction between a base such as NaOH and water results in the formation of sodium ions (Na+) and hydroxide ions (OH-).\n\nAnother important aspect of acids and bases is their neutralization reaction, which occurs when an acid and a base react with each other to form a salt and water. This process can be represented by the general equation: Acid + Base → Salt + Water.\n\nIn addition to these fundamental properties and reactions, it's essential to note that acids and bases exhibit distinct physical and chemical characteristics in laboratory settings. For instance, acids typically have a sour taste, while bases are often bitter or soapy. They also react differently with metals, as demonstrated by the reaction between zinc granules and dilute sulfuric acid.\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of these concepts, I recommend exploring the topic further using resources such as diagrams and experiments. Specifically, refer to the diagram showing the pH scale (pH 0-14), which provides a quantitative measure of acidity or alkalinity in solutions.\n\nWould you like to explore this topic further?", "duration_ms": 5789, "error": null}

Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nSince the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties. Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution? Do acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this. Activity, what do\nyou infer about the acidic character of:\n(i)\ndry HCl gas\n(ii)\nHCl solution? a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Preparation of HCl gas\nThis experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced\nin the presence of water. The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water. HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+). H+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water. Let us see\nwhat happens when a base is dissolved in water. NaOH(s)\nH O\n\n\n→\n Na+ (aq) + OH– (aq)\nNote to teachers: If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced\nthrough a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.

Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis. Do You\nKnow? All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis? Now as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\n–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows –\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nH X + M OH → MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\n– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\n\nThus, the reaction of a metal with an acid can be summarised as –\nAcid + Metal → Salt + Hydrogen gas\nCan you now write the equations for the reactions you have observed?

The reaction taking place is written as –\nNaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\nThe reaction between an acid and a base to give a salt and water is\nknown as a neutralisation reaction. In general, a neutralisation reaction\ncan be written as –\nBase + Acid → Salt + Water\n2.1.5 Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids\n\n\nScience\n\nNow write and balance the equation for the above reaction. Since\nmetallic oxides react with acids to give salts and water, similar to the\nreaction of a base with an acid, metallic oxides are said to be basic oxides. 2.1.6 Reaction of a Non-metallic Oxide with Base\nYou saw the reaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide\n(lime water) in Activity to\ninvestigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic. Acids, Bases and Salts\n\nThe bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in a figure. But you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct\nelectricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions. Acids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as Cl– in HCl, NO3\n– in\nHNO3, SO2–\n\nin H2SO4, CH3COO– in CH3COOH.\n\nHigher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value. The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (a figure). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH. U\nS\nI\nN\n? 1. Why do HCl, HNO3, etc., show acidic characters in aqueous solutions\nwhile solutions of compounds like alcohol and glucose do not show acidic\ncharacter? 2. Why does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity? 3. Why does dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper? 4. While diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be\nadded to water and not water to the acid? 5. How is the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+) affected when a\nsolution of an acid is diluted? 6.

When an acid reacts with a base, it forms a salt and water, as shown in the equation:\n\nBase + Acid → Salt + Water\n\nThis concept is crucial because it explains why acids and bases have opposite effects on certain substances. For example, when you add lemon juice (an acid) to baking soda (a base), they react to form a salt and water, neutralizing each other's acidity.\n\n**Key Properties of Acids:**\n\n1. **Acidic Character:** Acids are characterized by their ability to donate H+ ions (hydrogen ions) in solution.\n2. **pH Value:** The pH value of an acid is less than 7, indicating its acidic nature.\n3. **Conductivity:** Acids conduct electricity due to the presence of H+ ions.\n\n**Key Properties of Bases:**\n\n1. **Basic Character:** Bases are characterized by their ability to accept H+ ions (hydrogen ions) in solution.\n2. **pH Value:** The pH value of a base is greater than 7, indicating its basic nature.\n3. **Conductivity:** Bases conduct electricity due to the presence of OH- ions.\n\n**Key Reactions of Acids and Bases:**\n\n1. **Neutralization Reaction:** When an acid reacts with a base, it forms a salt and water.\n2. **Acid-Base Titration:** A common technique used to determine the concentration of acids or bases by reacting them with a known amount of another substance.\n\nNow that you know the key properties and reactions of Acids and Bases, do you want to explore more about this topic further?", "duration_ms": 6096, "error": null}
