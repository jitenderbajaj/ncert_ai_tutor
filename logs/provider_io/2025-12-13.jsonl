Specifically, it seems to cover topics like balancing chemical equations, physical states of reactants and products, and various types of chemical reactions (e.g., displacement reactions, oxidation and reduction).\n\nBased on this analysis, I can tell you more about the concept of \"balancing chemical equations.\"\n\nBalancing chemical equations is a crucial step in chemistry that helps us understand the stoichiometry of a reaction. It involves adjusting the coefficients of the reactants and products to ensure that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation.\n\nIn the context provided, we see an example of balancing the oxygen atoms in the equation Fe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + 4 H2. The student is asked to balance the hydrogen atoms as well, but then realizes that adding more coefficients won't completely balance the equation. Instead, they take three atoms of Fe on the LHS and adjust the other coefficients accordingly.\n\nThe final balanced equation is:\n\n3 Fe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + 4 H2\n\nThis equation shows that for every 3 atoms of Fe, 4 atoms of H2O are required to produce 1 atom of Fe3O4 and 4 atoms of H2.

Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the burning of magnesium in air. 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants. In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq.

In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial\nsubstance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical\nand chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical\nchange occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place. You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a\nchemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction\nhas taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to\nthese 1.1\nBurning of a magnesium ribbon in air and collection of magnesium\noxide in a watch-glass\nActivity needs\nthe teacher’s assistance.

Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\nchemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and\nmagnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –\nMg + O2 → MgO\n(1.2)\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the\nLHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the\nsame on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced.\n\nStep III: It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound\nthat contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a\nproduct. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum\nnumber of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe3O4 and the element\noxygen in it.

To make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states\nof the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical\nformulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants\nand products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s),\nrespectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product\nis present as a solution in water. The balanced Eq.\n\nIf not,\nthen the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on\nboth sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the burning of magnesium in air. 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants. In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step. The word-equation for \n\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation. Let us try to balance the following chemical equation –\nFe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.4)\n\nScience\n\nStep I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each\nformula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the\nequation. Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.5)\nStep II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the\nunbalanced equation (1.5). Element\nNumber of atoms\nNumber of atoms\nin reactants (LHS)\nin products (RHS)\n\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we\ncannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the\nreactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient\n‘4’ as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation\nbecomes –\nFe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\nStep IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\nto proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced\nequation. To equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules\nof hydrogen as four on the RHS.\n\n(1.9) becomes\n3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)\n(1.10)\nNote that the symbol (g) is used with H2O to indicate that in this\nreaction water is used in the form of steam. Usually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless\nit is necessary to specify them. Sometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,\ncatalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow\nin the equation. For example –\nCO(g) + 2H (g)\n\n340atm\nCH OH(l)\n\n\n→\n\n(1.11)\n6CO (aq)\n12H O(l)\nC H O (aq)\n6O\n\n+\n+\nSunlight\n Chlorophyll\n→\n\n\n(aq)\n+6H O(l)\n(1.12)\n(Glucose)\nUsing these steps, can you balance Eq.
