A balanced chemical equation is essential as it ensures that the mass of elements remains the same before and after the reaction, with the number of atoms of each element being equal on both sides of the arrow. To balance an equation, one must draw boxes around each formula, list the number of atoms of different elements present in the unbalanced equation, and then make trials to balance the equation using the smallest whole number coefficient. The physical states of reactants and products can be mentioned along with their chemical formulae, represented by notations (g), (l), (aq), and (s) respectively.

Try solving different types of equations and see what works best for you.\n2. **Use the hit-and-trial method** to balance your equations.

It might take some trial and error, but it's a great way to learn how to balance equations.\n3. **Focus on one element at a time**. When balancing an equation, try to focus on one element at a time. For example, if you're trying to balance an equation with iron (Fe), start by looking at the number of Fe atoms on both sides of the equation and adjust the coefficients accordingly.\n4. **Use the correct notation for physical states**.

It may be a reactant or a\nproduct. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum\nnumber of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe3O4 and the element\noxygen in it.
