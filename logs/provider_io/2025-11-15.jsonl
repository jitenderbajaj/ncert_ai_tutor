The chapter begins by explaining that chemical changes occur when substances undergo transformations, resulting in new substances with different properties. To determine if a chemical reaction has taken place, we observe changes such as change in state, color, evolution of gas, or change in temperature.\n\nThe chapter then introduces the concept of word-equations and chemical formulas, which are used to represent chemical reactions in a concise manner. A word-equation is a sentence that describes a chemical reaction, while a chemical equation uses symbols and formulas to represent the reactants and products.\n\nThe chapter also explains how to write balanced chemical equations, which is essential for understanding chemical reactions.
