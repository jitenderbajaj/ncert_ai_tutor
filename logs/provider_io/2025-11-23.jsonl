Answer the student's question based on the provided textbook passages.\n\nQuestion: 📖 Explain a key concept from the chapter\n\nTextbook passages:\n[1] Step III: It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound\nthat contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a\nproduct. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum\nnumber of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe3O4 and the element\noxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on\nthe LHS.

(1.9) are\nequal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical\nequations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance\nthe equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.

This is done by using the smallest whole number coefficient, as mentioned in Step VI of the textbook passage [1].\n\nThe process of balancing a chemical equation can be broken down into several steps:\n\nStep I: Draw boxes around each formula to isolate the elements.\n\nStep II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the unbalanced equation.\n\nStep III: Balance one element at a time, starting with the most abundant element. For example, if oxygen is not balanced, add a coefficient to the reactant or product containing oxygen until the number of oxygen atoms is equal on both sides.\n\nStep IV: Once an element is balanced, move on to the next element and repeat the process.\n\nStep V: Check th", "duration_ms": 7356, "error": null}

Sometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,\ncatalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow\nin the equation. For example –\nCO(g) + 2H (g)\n\n340atm\nCH OH(l)\n\n\n→\n\n(1.11)\n6CO (aq)\n12H O(l)\nC H O (aq)\n6O\n\n+\n+\nSunlight\n Chlorophyll\n→\n\n\n(aq)\n+6H O(l)\n(1.12)\n(Glucose)\nUsing these steps, can you balance Eq.

Nor do atoms\ndisappear from the mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical\nreactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to\nproduce new substances.
