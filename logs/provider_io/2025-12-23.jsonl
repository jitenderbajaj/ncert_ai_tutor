If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations. a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted. Acids, Bases and Salts\n\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS? 2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS? 2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS? 2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS? 2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS? We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\nSince the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties. Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution? Do acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this. Activity, what do\nyou infer about the acidic character of:\n(i)\ndry HCl gas\n(ii)\nHCl solution? a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Preparation of HCl gas\nThis experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced\nin the presence of water. The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water. HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+). H+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water. Let us see\nwhat happens when a base is dissolved in water. NaOH(s)\nH O\n\n\n→\n Na+ (aq) + OH– (aq)\nNote to teachers: If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced\nthrough a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.

Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis. Do You\nKnow? All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis? Now as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\n–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows –\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nH X + M OH → MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\n– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\n\nThus, the reaction of a metal with an acid can be summarised as –\nAcid + Metal → Salt + Hydrogen gas\nCan you now write the equations for the reactions you have observed?

The reaction taking place is written as –\nNaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\nThe reaction between an acid and a base to give a salt and water is\nknown as a neutralisation reaction. In general, a neutralisation reaction\ncan be written as –\nBase + Acid → Salt + Water\n2.1.5 Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids\n\n\nScience\n\nNow write and balance the equation for the above reaction. Since\nmetallic oxides react with acids to give salts and water, similar to the\nreaction of a base with an acid, metallic oxides are said to be basic oxides. 2.1.6 Reaction of a Non-metallic Oxide with Base\nYou saw the reaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide\n(lime water) in Activity to\ninvestigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic. Acids, Bases and Salts\n\nThe bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in a figure. But you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct\nelectricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions.

This concept is crucial in understanding many laboratory applications, including titration experiments and chemical testing.\n\nIn neutralization reactions, an acid (typically a hydrogen-containing compound) reacts with a base (typically an oxide or hydroxide), resulting in the release of heat, gas, and the formation of a new compound called a salt. The reaction is often denoted as:\n\nBase + Acid → Salt + Water\n\nFor example, when sodium hydroxide (NaOH) reacts with hydrochloric acid (HCl):\n\nNaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\n**Laboratory Applications:**\n\n1. **Titration Experiments:** Neutralization reactions are used in titration experiments to determine the concentration of an unknown substance. By adding a known amount of acid or base, you can calculate the amount of the unknown substance.\n2. **Chemical Testing:** Neutralization reactions are used to test the presence of certain compounds, such as acids and bases, in a sample. For example, adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to a solution containing acetic acid (CH3COOH) will produce carbon dioxide gas, indicating the presence of an acid.\n3. **Metal- Acid Reactions:** Neutralization reactions are used to study the properties of metals and their reactions with acids.\n\n**Reactions Involving Acids and Bases:**\n\n1. **Zinc Granules and Dilute Sulphuric Acid:** When zinc granules react with dilute sulphuric acid, they produce hydrogen gas, which can be detected by passing it through a soap solution or burning the gas in a candle flame.\n2. **Burning Candle and Gas Bubble:** When a burning candle is placed near a gas bubble filled with hydrogen, the candle will burn rapidly.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more about Neutralization Reactions, I'd be happy to help!", "duration_ms": 6671, "error": null}

Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nThus, the reaction of a metal with an acid can be summarised as –\nAcid + Metal → Salt + Hydrogen gas\nCan you now write the equations for the reactions you have observed? Activity are written as –\nTest tube A: Na CO\nHCl(aq)\nCl(aq)\nH O(l) + CO\n\n(s)\n(g)\n+\n→\n+\n\nTest tube B: NaHCO\nHCl(aq)\nCl(aq)\nH O(l) + CO\n\n(s)\n(g)\n+\n→\n+\nOn passing the carbon dioxide gas evolved through lime water,\nCa(OH)\nH O(l)\n\n(aq)\n(g)\nCaCO s\n\n+\n→\n+\n( )\n(Lime water)\n(White precipitate)\n� Place a few pieces of granulated zinc metal in a test tube. � Add 2 mL of sodium hydroxide solution and warm the contents\nof the test tube. � Repeat the rest of the steps as in \n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nActivity, we have observed that the effect of a base is\nnullified by an acid and vice-versa. The reaction taking place is written as –\nNaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\nThe reaction between an acid and a base to give a salt and water is\nknown as a neutralisation reaction. In general, a neutralisation reaction\ncan be written as –\nBase + Acid → Salt + Water\n2.1.5 Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids\n\n\nScience\n\nNow write and balance the equation for the above reaction. Since\nmetallic oxides react with acids to give salts and water, similar to the\nreaction of a base with an acid, metallic oxides are said to be basic oxides. 2.1.6 Reaction of a Non-metallic Oxide with Base\nYou saw the reaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide\n(lime water) in Activity to\ninvestigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic. Acids, Bases and Salts\n\nThe bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in a figure. But you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct\nelectricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions. Acids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as Cl– in HCl, NO3\n– in\nHNO3, SO2–\n\nin H2SO4, CH3COO– in CH3COOH.\n\nSince the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties. Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution?

Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+). H+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water.

Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?

This is because acids contain hydrogen ions (H+), which can donate a proton to the litmus molecule, causing it to lose its blue color and turn red.\n\nOn the other hand, bases are substances that have a bitter taste and can change the color of red litmus to blue. Bases also contain hydroxide ions (OH-), which can accept a proton from the litmus molecule, causing it to gain a new proton and regain its original color.\n\nSo, in summary, acids react with litmus by turning it red, while bases react with litmus by turning it blue.\n\n(see Figure 1.1, which illustrates the effect of different substances on litmus)\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify how acids and bases interact with litmus!

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\nHigher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value. The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (a figure). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH. U\nS\nI\nN\n? 1.

It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.

They can also neutralize each other by reacting with hydroxide ions (OH-).\n\nAcid-base indicators, like litmus paper, change color in response to changes in pH levels. This helps us identify whether a solution is acidic, basic, or neutral.\n\nWhen an acid or base reacts with water, it produces ions such as H3O+ and OH-, respectively. These ions determine the pH level of the resulting solution.\n\nAcids and bases also react with metals, causing them to undergo displacement reactions where they form salts and release hydrogen gas. For example, zinc displaces hydrogen from dilute acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n\nNow, let's explore some laboratory properties of Acids and Bases:\n\n1. **Acid-base neutralization**: When an acid and a base react with each other, they form a salt and water.\n   (see Figure 2.1)\n\n2. **pH scale**: The pH level measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. A pH value of 7 indicates neutrality, while values below 7 are acidic and above 7 are basic.\n\n3. **Acid-base indicators**: These substances change color when they come into contact with acids or bases, helping us identify their pH levels.\n\n4. **Conductivity**: Acidic solutions typically conduct electricity better than neutral or basic solutions because of the presence of hydrogen ions (H+).\n\n5. **Hydrogen gas production**: When acids react with water or metals like zinc, they release hydrogen gas.\n\nNow that you know more about Acids and Bases, do you have any questions or would you like to learn more about their laboratory properties?", "duration_ms": 6258, "error": null}

Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\n    User Question: \"How do natural indicators like turmeric detect bases?\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.

Answer the student's question using ONLY the provided context.\n\n    Context:\n    Acids, Bases\nand Salts\n\nCHAPTER\nou have learnt in your previous classes that the sour and bitter\ntastes of food are due to acids and bases, respectively, present in them. If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nScience\n\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1 UNDERST\n\n\n[... truncated 5085 chars]", "output_length": 1124, "output": "The user question \"How do natural indicators like turmeric detect bases?\" can be answered by explaining how acid-base indicators work in general, and then specifically focusing on turmeric.\n\nAcid-base indicators are substances that change their color in response to changes in the acidity or basicity of a solution. This property is used to distinguish between acids and bases.\n\nTurmeric, which is commonly used as an indicator, changes its color from yellow to reddish-brown when exposed to a base. However, turmeric itself is not a base; it is actually an acid. When turmeric reacts with a base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), the acid in turmeric neutralizes the base, resulting in the change of color.\n\nIn other words, when a solution containing turmeric comes into contact with a base, the turmeric reacts with the base to form a salt and water. This reaction causes the turmeric to lose its acidic properties and change its color, indicating that the original solution was basic.\n\nTherefore, while turmeric itself is an acid, it acts as a natural indicator by changing its color in response to the presence of bases.", "duration_ms": 4694, "error": null}

If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nSince the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties. Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution? Do acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this. Activity, what do\nyou infer about the acidic character of:\n(i)\ndry HCl gas\n(ii)\nHCl solution? a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Preparation of HCl gas\nThis experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced\nin the presence of water. The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water. HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+). H+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water. Let us see\nwhat happens when a base is dissolved in water. NaOH(s)\nH O\n\n\n→\n Na+ (aq) + OH– (aq)\nNote to teachers: If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced\nthrough a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.

Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis. Do You\nKnow? All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis? Now as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\n–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows –\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nH X + M OH → MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\n– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\n\nHigher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value. The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (a figure).

While diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be\nadded to water and not water to the acid? 5.

When you squeeze a lemon and put it in your mouth, the acidity in the juice makes your tongue feel sour. Similarly, vinegar is also acidic in nature.\n\nOn the other hand, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is a base. It's often used as a natural cleaner or to neutralize the smell of odors. When you mix baking soda with water, it forms a soap-like substance that can help clean surfaces.\n\nIn addition, some foods like tomatoes and citrus fruits are acidic in nature, while others like milk and yogurt have a basic pH level due to their high concentration of lactic acid or calcium carbonate.\n\nIn everyday life, we use these acids and bases for various purposes. For example, when you wash your hands with soap, the surfactant properties of the soap help break down dirt and grime, which is an acidic substance. Similarly, when you apply a basic ingredient like baking soda to a stain on your clothes, it helps neutralize the acidic color.\n\nNow, let's explore one specific topic further: how acids and bases interact with metals.\n\n(see Figure 2.1)", "duration_ms": 5498, "error": null}

Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations. a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\n    User Question: \"Can You Make a Color-Changing Indicate?\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.
