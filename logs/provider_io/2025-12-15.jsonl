Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\n    User Question: \"yes\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.

On the other hand, bases produce hydroxide ions (OH-), which are responsible for their basic properties. The interaction between acids and bases leads to neutralization reactions, resulting in the formation of salts and water.\n\nWhen a base is dissolved in water, it dissociates into its constituent ions, producing hydroxide ions. This can be seen in the given diagrams (refer to Figure 2.1), which show the dissociation of NaOH and KOH in water.\n\nIn contrast, acids do not dissociate completely in water, but instead produce hydrogen ions that combine with water molecules to form hydronium ions (H3O+). This is evident from the given reaction (HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl-), which shows the formation of H3O+ ions when hydrochloric acid reacts with water.\n\nTo summarize, acids produce hydrogen ions in solution, while bases produce hydroxide ions. The strength of an acid or base is determined by its ability to dissociate and produce these ions, which can be measured using the pH scale.", "duration_ms": 4874, "error": null}

In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nSince the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties. Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution?

The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water. HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+). H+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water.

Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis? Now as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\n–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows –\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nH X + M OH → MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\n– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations. a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\nScience\n\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1 UNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERSTANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\n2.1.1 Acids and Bases in the Laboratory\n\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nWhich of these – vanilla, onion and clove, can be used as olfactory\nindicators on the basis of your observations?

However, when it comes to neutralizing acidity, we need to think about which property is most relevant: pH or acidity.\n\nIn this case, I would suggest baking soda solution (sodium bicarbonate) as a remedy for acidity after overeating. Baking soda is a base that can help neutralize stomach acid and provide relief from heartburn and indigestion.\n\nI chose baking soda because it is a mild base that is less likely to cause an allergic reaction or interact with other medications. Additionally, its pH level is relatively high, which makes it effective at neutralizing acidic substances without causing further irritation.\n\nWhile lemon juice and vinegar are both acidic in nature, they may exacerbate the problem rather than alleviate it. Lemon juice, in particular, can be quite acidic and may irritate the stomach lining even more.\n\nSo, if someone in your family is suffering from acidity after overeating, I would recommend offering them a baking soda solution to help neutralize their stomach acid and provide relief from discomfort.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!", "duration_ms": 5218, "error": null}
