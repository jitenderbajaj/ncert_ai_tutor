This is a crucial aspect of chemical reactions in chemistry.\n\nOxidation and reduction are two types of chemical reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from one substance to another. Oxidation is the process where an atom, molecule, or ion loses one or more electrons, usually resulting in an increase in its oxidation state. On the other hand, reduction is the process where an atom, molecule, or ion gains one or more electrons, leading to a decrease in its oxidation state.\n\nIn many chemical reactions, both oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously, and together they form a balanced chemical equation. For example:\n\nIron (Fe) + Oxygen (O2) → Iron(III) Oxide (Fe2O3)\n\nIn this reaction, iron is oxidized from its elemental state to Fe3+ in iron(III) oxide, while oxygen is reduced from its molecular state to O2- in the form of iron(III) oxide.", "duration_ms": 4164, "error": null}

It highlights that by selecting this compound, we can easily identify the maximum number of atoms present in the reactants and products.\n\n**Key steps:**\n\n1. Identify the element with the maximum number of atoms on both sides.\n2. Balance the atoms of the identified element using the smallest whole-number coefficient.\n3. Check if the numbers of atoms of each element are equal on both sides to ensure balance.\n\nIn the context, we see an example where iron (Fe) is balanced by adding a coefficient of 3 on the reactants' side to match the 3 Fe atoms in Fe3O4. The resulting equation is: 3 Fe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + 4 H2.\n\n**Why is balancing important?**\n\nBalancing chemical equations helps us ensure that the law of conservation of mass is obeyed, meaning that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction. By balancing an equation, we can accurately predict the quantities of reactants and products required for a given reaction.\n\nDo you have any questions about balancing chemical equations or would you like to explore other topics related to chemical reactions?", "duration_ms": 5363, "error": null}

Now the partly balanced equation\nbecomes –\nFe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\nStep IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\nto proceed further.

In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial\nsubstance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical\nand chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical\nchange occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place. You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a\nchemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction\nhas taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to\nthese 1.1\nBurning of a magnesium ribbon in air and collection of magnesium\noxide in a watch-glass\nActivity needs\nthe teacher’s assistance.

Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\nchemical reaction.

Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the burning of magnesium in air. 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants. In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step. The word-equation for \n\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation. Let us try to balance the following chemical equation –\nFe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.4)\n\nScience\n\nStep I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each\nformula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the\nequation. Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.5)\nStep II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the\nunbalanced equation (1.5). Element\nNumber of atoms\nNumber of atoms\nin reactants (LHS)\nin products (RHS)\n\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we\ncannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the\nreactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient\n‘4’ as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation\nbecomes –\nFe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\nStep IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\nto proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced\nequation. To equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules\nof hydrogen as four on the RHS.\n\n    User Question: \"yes\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.

In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial\nsubstance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical\nand chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical\nchange occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place. You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a\nchemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction\nhas taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to\nthese 1.1\nBurning of a magnesium ribbon in air and collection of magnesium\noxide in a watch-glass\nActivity needs\nthe teacher’s assistance.

Fischer\n\nScience\n\n\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations\n\n1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation\nIs there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations? Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\nchemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and\nmagnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –\nMg + O2 → MgO\n(1.2)\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the\nLHS and RHS of the arrow.

What form of energy is causing these decomposition reactions? We have seen that the decomposition reactions require energy either\nin the form of heat, light or electricity for breaking down the reactants. Reactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic\nreactions. Chemical Reactions and Equations\n\nWhy does the iron nail become brownish in colour and the blue colour\nof copper sulphate solution fades? The following chemical reaction takes place in this Activity–\nFe(s) + CuSO4(aq) →\nFeSO4(aq) + Cu(s)\n(1.24)\n(Copper sulphate)\n(Iron sulphate)\nIn this reaction, iron has displaced or removed another element,\ncopper, from copper sulphate solution. This reaction is known as\ndisplacement reaction. Other examples of displacement reactions are\nZn(s) + CuSO4(aq) →\nZnSO4(aq) + Cu(s)\n(1.25)\n(Copper sulphate)\n(Zinc sulphate)\nPb(s) + CuCl2(aq) →\nPbCl2(aq) + Cu(s)\n(1.26)\n(Copper chloride)\n(Lead chloride)\nZinc and lead are more reactive elements than copper. They displace\ncopper from its compounds. 1.2.4 Double Displacement Reaction\n\n\nScience\n\n1.2.5 Oxidation and Reduction\n\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations\n\nIn reaction (1.31) carbon is oxidised to CO and ZnO is reduced to Zn. In reaction (1.32) HCl is oxidised to Cl2 whereas MnO2 is reduced to MnCl2.\n\nIf not,\nthen the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on\nboth sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the burning of magnesium in air. 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants. In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step. The word-equation for \n\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation. Let us try to balance the following chemical equation –\nFe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.4)\n\nScience\n\nStep I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each\nformula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the\nequation. Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.5)\nStep II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the\nunbalanced equation (1.5). Element\nNumber of atoms\nNumber of atoms\nin reactants (LHS)\nin products (RHS)\n\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we\ncannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the\nreactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient\n‘4’ as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation\nbecomes –\nFe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\nStep IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\nto proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced\nequation. To equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules\nof hydrogen as four on the RHS.\n\n    User Question: \"yes\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.
