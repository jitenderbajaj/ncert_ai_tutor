Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution?

If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power.

In the context of this chapter, we're introduced to the pH scale, which measures hydrogen ion concentration in a solution. The pH scale ranges from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline), with each number representing a specific level of acidity or basicity.\n\nAcid-base indicators are used to distinguish between acids and bases, but what about quantitatively determining the strength of an acid or base? This is where the universal indicator comes into play. The universal indicator mixture shows different colors at various hydrogen ion concentrations, allowing us to measure pH levels.\n\nThe question posed here seems to ask if we can determine the \"yes\" answer related to acid-base strengths using the provided context. Given this, I'd like to explore the topic of how strong acid or base solutions are further with you.\n\nTo do so, let's recall how we've been studying acids and bases in the laboratory. We've seen that metals react with acids to produce hydrogen gas, forming salts and water. This reaction suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions (H+(aq)) in solution, which contribute to their acidic properties. Similarly, bases generate hydroxide (OH–) ions in water.\n\nConsidering these aspects, it seems reasonable to conclude that measuring the strength of acid or base solutions involves determining their pH levels using a universal indicator or pH scale. This allows us to quantify the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution and understand its acidity or basicity.\n\nSo, the answer to whether we can determine the strength of an acid or base solution is indeed \"yes,\" but it requires utilizing the pH scale and understanding how acids and bases interact with water to produce hydrogen ions.\n\nNow, would you like to explore this topic further or move on to another concept?", "duration_ms": 6033, "error": null}

If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nHigher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value. The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (a figure). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH. U\nS\nI\nN\n? 1.

Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\n    User Question: \"yes\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.

In other words, acids release H+ ions, while bases absorb them.\n\nIn the case of acids like HCl, they produce H+ ions when dissolved in water, which is responsible for their acidic properties. On the other hand, bases like NaOH dissolve in water and release OH- ions, which are responsible for their basic properties.\n\n**(see Figure 1.2)**\n\nThe diagram shows how an acid (HCl) reacts with water to produce H+ ions, while a base (NaOH) reacts with water to produce OH- ions.\n\n**Can we conclude that acids only produce H+ ions in aqueous solutions?**\n\nNo, we can't conclude that acids only produce H+ ions in aqueous solutions. According to the experiment mentioned in the text, dry HCl gas does not change the colour of dry litmus paper, indicating that it doesn't release H+ ions immediately. However, when HCl is mixed with water, it produces H+ ions, which is responsible for its acidic properties.\n\n**(see Figure 1.3)**\n\nThe diagram shows how HCl reacts with water to produce H+ ions, while dry HCl gas does not react with litmus paper.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the concept of acids and bases!", "duration_ms": 5455, "error": null}
