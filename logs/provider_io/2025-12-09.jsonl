This can involve changes to physical states, such as from solid to liquid to gas, or even changes to elements themselves. \n\nOne way to represent this change is through the use of chemical equations, where we write down what happens before and after the reaction using symbols for elements and compounds.\n\nLet's take a closer look at how we balance these chemical reactions. When we start balancing with the compound that contains the maximum number of atoms, we often choose an element or compound in which there are more atoms present on one side of the equation than on the other.\n\nFor instance, when we examine the reaction between iron and copper sulphate, we can see how iron displaces copper from its solution. To balance this reaction, we start by looking at the elements involved.\n\nHere's an example of a chemical equation for this process:\n\nFe(s) + CuSO4(aq) → FeSO4(aq) + Cu(s)\n\nWe can see that in the reactants (left side), there are 1 iron atom and 8 copper atoms, while on the products (right side), there's 1 iron atom and 1 copper atom. To balance this reaction, we need to adjust the coefficients.\n\nLet's look at another example of a chemical equation involving magnesium:\n\n2AgBr(s) → 2Ag(s) + Br2(g)\n\nHere, we can see that initially, there are 2 silver bromide molecules on the left side with 4 atoms of bromine. On the right side, we have 2 silver atoms and 1 molecule of bromine gas. To balance this reaction, we need to adjust the coefficients.\n\nWhen it comes to understanding what type of energy is required for these reactions, we can see that some of them are endothermic - meaning they absorb energy from their surroundings. The example of black and white photography shows how light energy causes decomposition reactions in silver bromide.\n\n**Key Takeaway**\n\nChemical reactions involve changes in the composition of substances, often involving physical states or elements themselves. Balancing these equations requires us to carefully count atoms on both sides of the reaction and adjust coefficients as needed.", "duration_ms": 6555, "error": null}

In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial\nsubstance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical\nand chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical\nchange occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place. You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a\nchemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction\nhas taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to\nthese 1.1\nBurning of a magnesium ribbon in air and collection of magnesium\noxide in a watch-glass\nActivity needs\nthe teacher’s assistance.

Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\nchemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and\nmagnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –\nMg + O2 → MgO\n(1.2)\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the\nLHS and RHS of the arrow.

What form of energy is causing these decomposition reactions? We have seen that the decomposition reactions require energy either\nin the form of heat, light or electricity for breaking down the reactants. Reactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic\nreactions. Chemical Reactions and Equations\n\nWhy does the iron nail become brownish in colour and the blue colour\nof copper sulphate solution fades? The following chemical reaction takes place in this Activity–\nFe(s) + CuSO4(aq) →\nFeSO4(aq) + Cu(s)\n(1.24)\n(Copper sulphate)\n(Iron sulphate)\nIn this reaction, iron has displaced or removed another element,\ncopper, from copper sulphate solution. This reaction is known as\ndisplacement reaction. Other examples of displacement reactions are\nZn(s) + CuSO4(aq) →\nZnSO4(aq) + Cu(s)\n(1.25)\n(Copper sulphate)\n(Zinc sulphate)\nPb(s) + CuCl2(aq) →\nPbCl2(aq) + Cu(s)\n(1.26)\n(Copper chloride)\n(Lead chloride)\nZinc and lead are more reactive elements than copper. They displace\ncopper from its compounds. 1.2.4 Double Displacement Reaction\n\n\nScience\n\n1.2.5 Oxidation and Reduction\n\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations\n\nIn reaction (1.31) carbon is oxidised to CO and ZnO is reduced to Zn. In reaction (1.32) HCl is oxidised to Cl2 whereas MnO2 is reduced to MnCl2.\n\nIf not,\nthen the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on\nboth sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the burning of magnesium in air. 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants. In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step. The word-equation for \n\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation. Let us try to balance the following chemical equation –\nFe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.4)\n\nScience\n\nStep I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each\nformula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the\nequation. Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.5)\nStep II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the\nunbalanced equation (1.5). Element\nNumber of atoms\nNumber of atoms\nin reactants (LHS)\nin products (RHS)\n\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we\ncannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the\nreactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient\n‘4’ as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation\nbecomes –\nFe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\nStep IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\nto proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced\nequation. To equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules\nof hydrogen as four on the RHS.\n\n    User Question: \"yes\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.

This is known as the law of conservation of mass, which states that matter cannot be created or destroyed during a chemical reaction.\n\nIn our context, we have been using the \"hit-and-trial\" method to balance equations. The process involves selecting a compound with the maximum number of atoms and then balancing each element separately.\n\nFor example, in the case of Fe3O4 and oxygen, we started by counting the number of oxygen atoms on both sides: 4 oxygen atoms on the right-hand side (RHS) and only 1 on the left-hand side (LHS). To balance this equation, we added a coefficient of 4 to the hydrogen atoms on the RHS.\n\nSimilarly, when balancing iron atoms, we took three atoms of Fe on the LHS to equalize it with one atom of Fe on the RHS.
