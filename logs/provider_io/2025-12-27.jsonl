Simply put, pH is a number that indicates whether a solution is acidic or basic. The pH scale ranges from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). A pH of 7 is neutral, while values less than 7 represent an acidic solution and values greater than 7 represent a basic solution.\n\nWe can measure pH using a universal indicator, which shows different colors at different concentrations of hydrogen ions. The pH scale helps us quantify the strength of an acid or base in a solution.\n\nReturn JSON with EXACT schema:\n{\n  \"boredom\": {\"detected\": true/false, \"score\": 0.0, \"reasons\": [\"...\"]},\n  \"interventions\": [\n    {\"position\":\"inline\",\"type\":\"micro_quiz|choose_path|study_tip|hints\",\"content\":\"...\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nGuidelines:\n- If boredom score >= 0.6 OR user seems stuck, return 2-4 interventions.\n- Otherwise return 1-2 interventions.\n- Ensure at least one intervention is \"micro_quiz\" and includes:\n  - 2 questions\n  - self-score line (0/2, 1/2, 2/2)\n  - streak challenge line\n- If HOTS level is \"hard\", include one challenge question inside quiz or as a second intervention.", "prompt_sanitized": "You are the Engagement Agent for an NCERT AI Tutor.\n\nMission:\n- Append engagement interventions at the END of the answer (append-only).\n- Detect boredom/low engagement using Chat History + Question + Draft Answer.\n- ALWAYS return at least 1 intervention (even if boredom is low).\n- Generate a grounded micro-quiz using ONLY Draft Answer + Sources.\n- Add light gamification: self-score + streak.\n- Emojis are allowed (max 2 per intervention).\n\nHard rules:\n- Do NOT introduce new factual claims beyond Draft Answer and Sources.\n- Do NOT rewrite the Draft Answer.\n- Output MUST be valid JSON only (no markdown, no extra text).\n- Keep interventions concise and student-friendly.\n- In the \"micro_quiz\" intervention content, the FIRST line MUST be exactly:\n  📌 Grounded from: chunk parent_4\n- If the line above is empty, omit the grounding line entirely (do not invent one).\n\nInputs:\nQuestion: What is the pH level of an acidic substance?\nHOTS level: None\n\nGrounding label (use verbatim if non-empty):\n📌 Grounded from: chunk parent_4\n\nChat History (recent):\n[{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"☀️ Good afternoon student_001!

If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations. a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\nScience\n\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1 UNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERSTANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\n2.1.1 Acids and Bases in the Laboratory\n\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nWhich of these – vanilla, onion and clove, can be used as olfactory\nindicators on the basis of your observations?

The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (a figure).

Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellet\n\n[... truncated 7049 chars]", "output_length": 1372, "output": "I'd be happy to help you with your question about acidity and bases. \n\nAcidity and alkalinity are measured on the pH scale, which ranges from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline).
