If we see a dog running, or a cow chewing cud, or a man\nshouting loudly on the street, we know that these are living beings. What\nif the dog or the cow or the man were asleep? We would still think that\nthey were alive, but how did we know that? We see them breathing, and\nwe know that they are alive. What about plants? How do we know that\nthey are alive? We see them green, some of us will say. But what about\nplants that have leaves of colours other than green? They grow over\ntime, so we know that they are alive, some will say. In other words, we\ntend to think of some sort of movement, either growth-related or not, as\ncommon evidence for being alive. But a plant that is not visibly growing is\nstill alive, and some animals can breathe without visible movement. So\nusing visible movement as the defining characteristic of life is not enough.\nMovements over very small scales will be invisible to the naked eye –\nmovements of molecules, for example. Is this invisible molecular\nmovement necessary for life? If we ask this 5.1 WHA\n5.1 WHA\n5.1 WHA\n5.1 WHA\n5.1 WHAT ARE LIFE PROCESSES?\nT ARE LIFE PROCESSES?\nT ARE LIFE PROCESSES?\nT ARE LIFE PROCESSES?\nT ARE LIFE PROCESSES?\nThe maintenance functions of living organisms must go on even when\nthey are not doing anything particular. Even when we are just sitting in\n\nScience\n\nclass, even if we are just asleep, this maintenance job has to go on.\nThe processes which together perform this maintenance job are\nlife processes.\nSince these maintenance processes are needed to prevent damage\nand break-down, energy is needed for them. This energy comes from\noutside the body of the individual organism. So there must be a process\nto transfer a source of energy from outside the body of the organism,\nwhich we call food, to the inside, a process we commonly call nutrition.\nIf the body size of the organisms is to grow, additional raw material will\nalso be needed from outside. Since life on earth depends on carbonbased molecules, most of these food sources are also carbon-based.\nDepending on the complexity of these carbon sources, different\norganisms can then use different kinds of nutritional processes.\nThe outside sources of energy could be quite varied, since the\nenvironment is not under the control of the individual organism. These\nsources of energy, therefore, need to be broken down or built up in the\nbody, and must be finally converted to a uniform source of energy that\ncan be used for the various molecular movements needed for\nmaintaining living structures, as well as to the kind of molecules the\nbody needs to grow. For this, a series of chemical reactions in the\nbody are necessary. Oxidising-reducing reactions are some of the most\ncommon chemical means to break-down molecules. For this, many\norganisms use oxygen sourced from outside the body. The process\nof acquiring oxygen from outside the body, and to use it in the process\nof break-down of food sources for cellular needs, is what we call\nrespiration.\nIn the case of a single-celled organism, no specific organs for taking\nin food, exchange of gases or removal of wastes may be needed because\nthe entire surface of the organism is in contact with the environment.\nBut what happens when the body size of the organism increases and\nthe body design becomes more complex? In multi-cellular organisms,\nall the cells may not be in direct contact with the surrounding\nenvironment. Thus, simple diffusion will not meet the requirements of\nall the cells.\nWe have seen previously how, in multi-cellular organisms, various\nbody parts have specialised in the functions they perform. We are familiar\nwith the idea of these specialised tissues, and with their organisation in\nthe body of the organism. It is therefore not surprising that the uptake\nof food and of oxygen will also be the function of specialised tissues.\nHowever, this poses a problem, since the food and oxygen are now taken\nup at one place in the body of the organisms, while all parts of the body\nneed them. This situation creates a need for a transportation system for\ncarrying food and oxygen from one place to another in the body.\nWhen chemical reactions use the carbon source and the oxygen for\nenergy generation, they create by-products that are not only useless\nfor the cells of the body, but could even be harmful. These waste byproducts are therefore needed to be removed from the body and discarded\noutside by a process called excretion. Again, if the basic rules for body\n\nLife Processes\n\ndesign in multi-cellular organisms are followed, a specialised tissue for\nexcretion will be developed, which means that the transportation system\nwill need to transport waste away from cells to this excretory tissue.\nLet us cconsider these various processes, so essential to maintain\nlife, one by one.\nU\nS\nI\nN\n?\n1.\nWhy is diffusion insufficient to meet the oxygen requirements of multicellular organisms like humans?\n2.\nWhat criteria do we use to decide whether something is alive?\n3.\nWhat are outside raw materials used for by an organism?\n4.\nWhat processes would you cconsider essential for maintaining life?\n5.2 NUTRITION\n5.2 NUTRITION\n5.2 NUTRITION\n5.2 NUTRITION\n5.2 NUTRITION\nWhen we walk or ride a bicycle, we are using up energy. Even when we\nare not doing any apparent activity, energy is needed to maintain a\nstate of order in our body. We also need materials from outside in order\nto grow, develop, synthesise protein and other substances needed in\nthe body. This source of energy and materials is the food we eat.\nHow do living things get their food?\nThe general requirement for energy and materials is common in all\norganisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways. Some organisms use simple\nfood material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon\ndioxide and water. These organisms, the autotrophs, include green\nplants and some bacteria. Other organisms utilise complex substances.\nThese complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones\nbefore they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body. To\nachieve this, organisms use bio-catalysts called enzymes. Thus, the\nheterotrophs survival depends directly or indirectly on autotrophs.\nHeterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi.\n5.2.1 Autotrophic Nutrition\nCarbon and energy requirements of the autotrophic organism are\nfulfilled by photosynthesis. It is the process by which autotrophs take\nin substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of\nenergy. This material is taken in the form of carbon dioxide and water\nwhich is converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and\nchlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant.\nWe will study how this takes place in the next section. The carbohydrates\nwhich are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which\nserves as the internal energy reserve to be used as and when required\nby the plant. A somewhat similar situation is seen in us where some of\nthe energy derived from the food we eat is stored in our body in the form\nof glycogen.\n\nScience\n\nLet us now see what actually happens during the process of\nphotosynthesis. The following events occur during this process –\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nVariegated leaf (a) before\nand (b) after starch test\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nCross-section of a leaf\nactivity which demonstrates that\nchlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis.\n\nLife Processes\n\nNow, let us study how the plant\nobtains carbon dioxide. In Class IX,\nwe had talked about stomata (a figure)\nwhich are tiny pores present on the\nsurface of the leaves. Massive amounts\nof gaseous exchange takes place in the\nleaves through these pores for the\npurpose of photosynthesis. But it is\nimportant to note here that exchange\nof gases occurs across the surface of\nstems, roots and leaves as well. Since\nlarge amounts of water can also be lost\nthrough these stomata, the plant\ncloses these pores when it does not\nneed carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. The opening and closing of the\npore is a function of the guard cells. The guard cells swell when water\nflows into them, causing the stomatal pore to open. Similarly the pore\ncloses if the guard cells shrink.\n�\nTake two healthy potted plants\nwhich are nearly the same size.\n�\nKeep them in a dark room for\nthree days.\n�\nNow place each plant on\nseparate glass plates. Place a\nwatch-glass containing potassium\nhydroxide by the side of one of\nthe plants. The potassium\nhydroxide is used to absorb\ncarbon dioxide.\n�\nCover both plants with separate\nbell-jars as shown in a figure.\n�\nUse vaseline to seal the bottom\nof the jars to the glass plates so\nthat the set-up is air-tight.\n�\nKeep the plants in sunlight for\nabout two hours.\n�\nPluck a leaf from each plant and check for the presence of starch as in the above activity.\n�\nDo both the leaves show the presence of the same amount of starch?\n�\nWhat can you conclude from this activity?\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure (a) Open and (b) closed stomatal pore\n\n\nScience\n\ntaken up in the form of inorganic nitrates or nitrites. Or it is taken up as\norganic compounds which have been prepared by bacteria from\natmospheric nitrogen.\n5.2.2 Heterotrophic Nutrition\nEach organism is adapted to its environment. The form of nutrition\ndiffers depending on the type and availability of food material as well\nas how it is obtained by the organism. For example, whether the food\nsource is stationary (such as grass) or mobile (such as a deer), would\nallow for differences in how the food is accessed and what is the nutritive\napparatus used by a cow and a lion. There is a range of strategies by\nwhich the food is taken in and used by the organism. Some organisms\nbreak-down the food material outside the body and then absorb it.\nExamples are fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms. Others\ntake in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can\nbe taken in and broken down depends on the body design and\nfunctioning. Some other organisms derive nutrition from plants or\nanimals without killing them. This parasitic nutritive strategy is used\nby a wide variety of organisms like cuscuta (amar-bel), ticks, lice,\nleeches and tape-worms.\n5.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition?\nSince the food and the way it is obtained differ, the digestive system is\ndifferent in various organisms. In single-celled organisms, the food\nmay be taken in by the entire surface. But as the complexity of the\norganism increases, different parts become specialised to perform\ndifferent functions. For example, Amoeba takes in food using\ntemporary finger-like extensions of the cell surface which fuse over\nthe food particle forming a food-vacuole (a figure). Inside the foodvacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones\nwhich then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested\nmaterial is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In\nParamoecium, which is also a unicellular organism, the cell has a\ndefinite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved\nto this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface\nof the cell.\n5.2.4 Nutrition in Human Beings\nThe alimentary canal is basically a long tube extending from the mouth\nto the anus. In a figure, we can see that the tube has different parts.\nVarious regions are specialised to perform different functions. What\nhappens to the food once it enters our body? We shall discuss this\nprocess here.\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nNutrition in Amoeba\n\nLife Processes\n\n\n\nScience\n\nhave often heard adults complaining about ‘acidity’. Can this be related\nto what has been discussed above?\nThe exit of food from the stomach is regulated by a sphincter muscle\nwhich releases it in small amounts into the small intestine. From the\nstomach, the food now enters the small intestine. This is the longest part\nof the alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of\nextensive coiling. The length of the small intestine differs in various\nanimals depending on the food they eat. Herbivores eating grass need a\nlonger small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested. Meat is easier\nto digest, hence carnivores like tigers have a shorter small intestine.\nThe small intestine is the site of the complete digestion of\ncarbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretions of the liver\nand pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is\nacidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act.\nBile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats.\nFats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes\nit difficult for enzymes to act on them. Bile salts break them down into\nsmaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action. This is similar\nto the emulsifying action of soaps on dirt that we have learnt about in\nChapter 4. The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains\nenzymes like trypsin for digesting proteins and lipase for breaking down\nemulsified fats. The walls of the small intestine contain glands which\nsecrete intestinal juice. The enzymes present in it finally convert the\nproteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrates into glucose and fats\ninto fatty acids and glycerol.\nDigested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner\nlining of the small intestine has numerous finger-like projections called\nvilli which increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are richly\nsupplied with blood vessels which take the absorbed food to each and\nevery cell of the body, where it is utilised for obtaining energy, building\nup new tissues and the repair of old tissues.\nThe unabsorbed food is sent into the large intestine where its wall\nabsorb more water from this material. The rest of the material is removed\nfrom the body via the anus. The exit of this waste material is regulated\nby the anal sphincter.\nMore to Know!\nDental caries\nDental caries or tooth decay causes gradual softening of enamel and dentine. It begins\nwhen bacteria acting on sugars produce acids that softens or demineralises the enamel.\nMasses of bacterial cells together with food particles stick to the teeth to form dental\nplaque. Saliva cannot reach the tooth surface to neutralise the acid as plaque covers\nthe teeth. Brushing the teeth after eating removes the plaque before the bacteria\nproduce acids. If untreated, microorganisms may invade the pulp, causing\ninflammation and infection.\n\nLife Processes\n\n5.3 RESPIR\n5.3 RESPIR\n5.3 RESPIR\n5.3 RESPIR\n5.3 RESPIRAAAAATION\nTION\nTION\nTION\nTION\n\n\nScience\n\nSummary paragraph:", "prompt_sanitized": "Summarize this NCERT chapter in ONE dense paragraph of 400-500 words.\n\nBook: Class10Science | Chapter: CH5\n\nSTRICT FORMAT:\n- Write as ONE continuous paragraph (no sections, headers, or bullets)\n- Direct factual content - NO meta-commentary like \"this chapter covers\" or \"students will learn\"\n- Cover: core concepts, main topics, key definitions\n- Skip: specific examples, activities, exercises, questions\n- Dense style: every sentence adds new information\n\nWRITE DIRECTLY - Start with the content, not commentary.\n\nChapter text:\nLife Processes\n\nCHAPTER\now do we tell the difference between what is alive and what is not\nalive?

However, this is insufficient, as even plants that are not visibly growing are still alive due to their ability to undergo metabolic processes. Life processes, on the other hand, refer to the maintenance functions that must occur within an organism even when it is not doing anything particular. These processes require energy, which comes from outside the body in the form of food, and involve various chemical reactions such as oxidation-reducing reactions to break down molecules. The process of acquiring oxygen from outside the body is known as respiration, and is essential for cellular movements and molecular growth. In multicellular organisms, specialized tissues are needed to take in food and oxygen, which then need to be transported throughout the body via a transportation system. Additionally, waste byproducts must be removed from the body through excretion, which involves specialized tissues as well. The general requirement for energy and materials is common across all organisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways, with autotrophs using simple food material obtained from inorganic sources such as carbon dioxide and water, while heterotrophs rely on complex substances that must be broken down into simpler ones before they can be used. The digestive system varies greatly between organisms, with single-celled organisms taking in food through their entire surface, while multicellular organisms have specialized parts for different functions. In humans, the alimentary canal is a long tube extending from the mouth to the anus, where food is broken down into nutrients that are absorbed by the walls of the intestine and utilized by the body.", "duration_ms": 5985, "error": null}
