On the other hand, reduction is when a substance loses oxygen or gains hydrogen during a reaction.\n\nThink of it like this: Imagine you have a battery that needs to be \"charged\". When it's fully charged (has lots of energy), it's like oxidation - the battery has gained energy (oxygen) and is ready to use. But when it runs out of energy (loses oxygen), it's like reduction - the battery has lost its energy, and we need to \"charge\" it again!\n\n**Oxidation and Reduction in Real-Life Examples**\n\nNow, let's look at some examples:\n\n1. When an iron nail is dipped in copper sulphate solution, the iron nail becomes brownish in color, and the blue color of the copper sulphate solution fades. This happens because iron displaces copper from its compounds (copper sulphate), which means iron has gained energy by \"taking\" oxygen from the copper.\n2. In black and white photography, silver bromide reacts with sunlight to produce a decomposition reaction, releasing silver particles. The energy from sunlight is absorbed during this reaction, making it an endothermic process.\n\n**Balancing Chemical Equations**\n\nNow that we've discussed oxidation and reduction, let's talk about balancing chemical equations!\n\nTake the equation:\n\n3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)\n\nOur task is to balance this equation. To do so, we need to make sure that the number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation are equal.\n\nAfter examining the equation and balancing it, we get:\n\n(see Figure 1.9 for the balanced equation)\n\nSo, there you have it! Oxidation and reduction are fundamental concepts in chemistry, and understanding them will help us write balanced chemical equations.", "duration_ms": 5969, "error": null}

To make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states\nof the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical\nformulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants\nand products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s),\nrespectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product\nis present as a solution in water. The balanced Eq.\n\nIf not,\nthen the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on\nboth sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the burning of magnesium in air. 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants. In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step. The word-equation for \n\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation. Let us try to balance the following chemical equation –\nFe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.4)\n\nScience\n\nStep I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each\nformula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the\nequation. Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.5)\nStep II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the\nunbalanced equation (1.5). Element\nNumber of atoms\nNumber of atoms\nin reactants (LHS)\nin products (RHS)\n\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we\ncannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the\nreactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient\n‘4’ as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation\nbecomes –\nFe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\nStep IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\nto proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced\nequation. To equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules\nof hydrogen as four on the RHS.\n\n(1.9) becomes\n3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)\n(1.10)\nNote that the symbol (g) is used with H2O to indicate that in this\nreaction water is used in the form of steam. Usually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless\nit is necessary to specify them.

In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the same before and after a chemical reaction.\n\nThink about it: if matter were created or destroyed during a chemical reaction, that would mean that some of the original atoms had disappeared or reappeared somewhere else! But we know from our everyday experiences and experiments that this never happens. So, what does happen instead? The mass is simply rearranged and transferred from one substance to another.\n\nTo illustrate this concept, let's consider an example: when magnesium burns in air (Eq. (1.2)), it reacts with oxygen to produce magnesium oxide and release energy. According to the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the elements present in the products must be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.\n\nLet's use the equation: Fe + O2 → Fe3O4\n\nAs we know from the explanation provided earlier, to balance this equation, we need to ensure that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the arrow.

(1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about\nthe physical state of each reactant and product? No information has\nbeen given in this equation about their physical states. To make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states\nof the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical\nformulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants\nand products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s),\nrespectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product\nis present as a solution in water. The balanced Eq.\n\nIf not,\nthen the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on\nboth sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the burning of magnesium in air. 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants. In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step. The word-equation for \n\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation. Let us try to balance the following chemical equation –\nFe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.4)\n\nScience\n\nStep I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each\nformula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the\nequation. Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.5)\nStep II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the\nunbalanced equation (1.5). Element\nNumber of atoms\nNumber of atoms\nin reactants (LHS)\nin products (RHS)\n\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we\ncannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the\nreactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient\n‘4’ as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation\nbecomes –\nFe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\nStep IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\nto proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced\nequation. To equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules\nof hydrogen as four on the RHS.\n\n(1.9) becomes\n3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)\n(1.10)\nNote that the symbol (g) is used with H2O to indicate that in this\nreaction water is used in the form of steam. Usually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless\nit is necessary to specify them. Sometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,\ncatalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow\nin the equation.

Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.\nIn this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life.\nDo You Know?\nLitmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution.

The reaction taking place is written as –\nNaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\nThe reaction between an acid and a base to give a salt and water is\nknown as a neutralisation reaction. In general, a neutralisation reaction\ncan be written as –\nBase + Acid → Salt + Water\n2.1.5 Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids\n\n\nScience\n\nNow write and balance the equation for the above reaction. Since\nmetallic oxides react with acids to give salts and water, similar to the\nreaction of a base with an acid, metallic oxides are said to be basic oxides.\n2.1.6 Reaction of a Non-metallic Oxide with Base\nYou saw the reaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide\n(lime water) in Activity to\ninvestigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic.\n\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nThe bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in a figure.\nBut you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct\nelectricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions.\nAcids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as Cl– in HCl, NO3\n– in\nHNO3, SO2–\n\nin H2SO4, CH3COO– in CH3COOH. Since the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties.\nRepeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity?\n2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution?\nDo acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this.\nActivity, what do\nyou infer about the acidic character of:\n(i)\ndry HCl gas\n(ii)\nHCl solution?\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Preparation of HCl gas\nThis experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced\nin the presence of water. The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water.\nHCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+).\nH+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water. Let us see\nwhat happens when a base is dissolved in water.\nNaOH(s)\nH O\n\n\n→\n Na+ (aq) + OH– (aq)\nNote to teachers: If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced\nthrough a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.\n\nScience\n\nKOH(s)\nK (aq)+OH (aq)\nH O\n\n+\n\n→\n\n–\nMg(OH)2(s)\nH O\n\n\n→\n Mg2+(aq)+2OH–(aq)\nBases generate hydroxide (OH–) ions in water. Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis.\nDo You\nKnow?\nAll bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?\nNow as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\n–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows –\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nH X + M OH → MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\n– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations.\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns.\nThe glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.\nMixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\nWe know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions.\nCan we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?\nCan we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\nA scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (a figure). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.\nU\nS\nI\nN\n?\n1.\nWhy do HCl, HNO3, etc., show acidic characters in aqueous solutions\nwhile solutions of compounds like alcohol and glucose do not show acidic\ncharacter?\n2.\nWhy does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity?\n3.\nWhy does dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper?\n4.\nWhile diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be\nadded to water and not water to the acid?\n5.\nHow is the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+) affected when a\nsolution of an acid is diluted?\n6.\nHow is the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH\n–) affected when excess\nbase is dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide?\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Variation of pH with the change in concentration of H+(aq) and OH–(aq) ions\n\nScience\n\n\n\nSaliva (before meal)\n\nSaliva (after meal)\n\nLemon juice\n\nColourless aerated\ndrink\n\nCarrot juice\n\nCoffee\n\nTomato juice\n\nTap water\n\n1M NaOH\n\n1M HCl\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nWhat is the pH of the soil in your backyard?\nPlants require a specific pH range for their healthy growth.

For example, NaCl and Na2SO4 belong to the\nfamily of sodium salts. Similarly, NaCl and KCl belong to the family\nof chloride salts. How many families can you identify among the\nsalts given in this Activity?\n2.4.2 pH of Salts\nActivity\nthat it is a neutral salt.\nSeawater contains many salts dissolved\nin it. Sodium chloride is separated from these\nsalts. Deposits of solid salt are also found in\nseveral parts of the world. These large crystals\nare often brown due to impurities. This is\ncalled rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed\nwhen seas of bygone ages dried up. Rock salt\nis mined like coal.\nYou must have heard about Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi March.

Let us see how one substance\nis used for making all these different substances.\nSodium hydroxide\nWhen electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium\nchloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The\nprocess is called the chlor-alkali process because of the products formed–\nchlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.\n2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) ® 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)\nChlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode.\nSodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three\nproducts produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the\ndifferent uses of these products.\nBleaching powder\nYou have already come to know that chlorine is produced during the\nelectrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used\nfor the manufacture of bleaching powder. Bleaching powder is produced\nby the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]. Bleaching powder\nis represented as Ca(ClO)2, though the actual composition is quite\ncomplex.\n2Ca(OH)2 + 2Cl2 ® Ca(ClO)2 + CaCl2 + 2H2O\na figure Important products from the chlor-alkali process\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nBleaching powder is used –\n(i)\nfor bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry, for bleaching\nwood pulp in paper factories and for bleaching washed clothes\nin laundry;\n(ii)\nas an oxidising agent in many chemical industries; and\n(iii)\nto make drinking water free from germs.\nBaking soda\nThe baking soda is commonly used in the kitchen for making tasty crispy\npakoras, etc. Sometimes it is added for faster cooking. The chemical\nname of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO3). It is\nproduced using sodium chloride as one of the raw materials.\nNaCl + H O + CO\n+ NH\nNH Cl + NaHCO\n\n→\n(Ammonium (Sodium\nchloride)\nhydrogencarbonate)\nDid you check the pH of sodium hydrogencarbonate in \n\nScience\n\nWhat does 10H2O signify?
