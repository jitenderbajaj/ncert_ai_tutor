Answer the student's question based on the provided textbook passages.\n\nQuestion: explain a key concept from the chapter\n\nTextbook passages:\n[1] Chemical Reactions\nand Equations\n\nCHAPTER\nconsider the following situations of daily life and think what happens\nwhen –\n�\nmilk is left at room temperature during summers. �\nan iron tawa/pan/nail is left exposed to humid atmosphere. �\ngrapes get fermented. �\nfood is cooked. �\nfood gets digested in our body. �\nwe respire. In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial\nsubstance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical\nand chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical\nchange occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place. You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a\nchemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction\nhas taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to\nthese 1.1\nBurning of a magnesium ribbon in air and collection of magnesium\noxide in a watch-glass\nActivity needs\nthe teacher’s assistance. It\nwould be better if students\nwear suitable eyeglasses. �\nClean a magnesium ribbon\nabout 3-4 cm long by rubbing\nit with sandpaper. �\nHold it with a pair of tongs. Burn it using a spirit lamp or\nburner and collect the ash so\nformed in a watch-glass as\nshown in a figure. Burn the\nmagnesium ribbon keeping it\naway as far as possible from\nyour eyes. �\nWhat do you observe? “Facts are not science — as the dictionary is not literature.”\nMartin H. Fischer\n\nScience\n\n\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations\n\n1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation\nIs there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations? Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\nchemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and\nmagnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –\nMg + O2 → MgO\n(1.2\n\n[... truncated 8429 chars]", "output_length": 1349, "output": "A key concept from the chapter \"Chemical Reactions and Equations\" is the law of conservation of mass. According to this law, mass cannot be created or destroyed during a chemical reaction. This means that the total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction must be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.\n\nIn other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the same before and after a chemical reaction. To balance a skeletal chemical equation, we need to ensure that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the arrow.\n\nFor example, consider the equation Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2. If we draw boxes around each formula and list the number of atoms of different elements present in the unbalanced equation, we can see that iron (Fe) has 1 atom on the LHS and 3 atoms on the RHS.\n\nTo balance this equation, we need to add a coefficient of 3 in front of Fe on the LHS. The balanced equation becomes:\n\n3Fe + 4H2O → Fe3O4 +", "duration_ms": 5888, "error": null}
