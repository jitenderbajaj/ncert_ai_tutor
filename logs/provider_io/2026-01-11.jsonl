Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations. a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\nSince the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties. Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution?

Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?

You also studied the nature, position and relative size of\nimages formed by lenses. How can these ideas help us in the study of\nthe human eye? The human eye uses light and enables us to see objects\naround us. It has a lens in its structure. What is the function of the lens\nin a human eye? How do the lenses used in spectacles correct defects of\nvision? Let us cconsider these 10.1 THE HUMAN EYE\nThe human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs.\nIt enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On\nclosing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell,\ntaste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to identify\ncolours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human\neye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful,\ncolourful world around us.\nThe human eye is like a camera. Its lens\nsystem forms an image on a light-sensitive\nscreen called the retina. Light enters the eye\nthrough a thin membrane called the cornea.\nIt forms the transparent bulge on the front\nsurface of the eyeball as shown in a figure.\nThe eyeball is approximately spherical in shape\nwith a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the\nrefraction for the light rays entering the eye\noccurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The\ncrystalline lens merely provides the finer\nadjustment of focal length required to focus\nobjects at different distances on the retina. We find a structure called iris\nbehind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the\nsize of the pupil. The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nThe human eye\n\nScience\n\nentering the eye. The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object\non the retina. The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous\nnumber of light-sensitive cells. The light-sensitive cells get activated\nupon illumination and generate electrical signals. These signals are\nsent to the brain via the optic nerves. The brain interprets these signals,\nand finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as\nthey are.\n10.1.1 Power of Accommodation\nThe eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature\ncan be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the\ncurvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the\nmuscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length\nincreases. This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are\nlooking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This\nincreases the curvature of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker.\nConsequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases. This enables\nus to see nearby objects clearly.\nThe ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called\naccommodation. However, the focal length of the eye lens cannot be\ndecreased below a certain minimum limit. Try to read a printed page by\nholding it very close to your eyes. You may see the image being blurred\nor feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you\nmust hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes. The minimum distance, at\nwhich objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the\nleast distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye.\nFor a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about\n25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is\ncalled the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a normal eye. You may note\nhere a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm and\ninfinity.\nSometimes, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and\ncloudy. This condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete\nloss of vision. It is possible to restore vision through a cataract surgery.\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\nSometimes, the eye may gradually lose its power of accommodation.\nIn such conditions, the person cannot see the objects distinctly and\ncomfortably. The vision becomes blurred due to the refractive defects\nof the eye.\nThere are mainly three common refractive defects of vision. These\nare (i) myopia or near-sightedness, (ii) Hypermetropia or farsightedness, and (iii) Presbyopia. These defects can be corrected by\nthe use of suitable spherical lenses. We discuss below these defects\nand their correction.\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colourful World\n\n(a)\nMyopia\nMyopia is also known as nearsightedness. A person with myopia\ncan see nearby objects clearly but\ncannot see distant objects distinctly.\nA person with this defect has the far\npoint nearer than infinity. Such a\nperson may see clearly upto a\ndistance of a few metres. In a myopic\neye, the image of a distant object is\nformed in front of the retina [a figure (b)] and not at the retina itself.\nThis defect may arise due to (i)\nexcessive curvature of the eye lens,\nor (ii) elongation of the eyeball. This\ndefect can be corrected by using a\nconcave lens of suitable power. This\nis illustrated in a figure (c). A\nconcave lens of suitable power will\nbring the image back on to the\nretina and thus the defect is corrected.\n(b)\nHypermetropia\nHypermetropia is also known as far-sightedness.\nA person with hypermetropia can see distant\nobjects clearly but cannot see nearby objects\ndistinctly. The near point, for the person, is farther\naway from the normal near point (25 cm). Such a\nperson has to keep a reading material much\nbeyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable\nreading. This is because the light rays from a\ncloseby object are focussed at a point behind the\nretina as shown in a figure (b). This defect arises\neither because (i) the focal length of the eye lens is\ntoo long, or (ii) the eyeball has become too small.\nThis defect can be corrected by using a convex\nlens of appropriate power. This is illustrated in\na figure (c). Eye-glasses with converging lenses\nprovide the additional focussing power required\nfor forming the image on the retina.\n(c) Presbyopia\nThe power of accommodation of the eye usually\ndecreases with ageing. For most people, the near\npoint gradually recedes away. They find it difficult\nto see nearby objects comfortably and distinctly\nwithout corrective eye-glasses. This defect is\ncalled Presbyopia. It arises due to the gradual\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\n(a), (b) The myopic eye, and (c) correction for myopia with a\nconcave lens\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\n(a), (b) The hypermetropic eye, and (c)\ncorrection for hypermetropia\nN = Near point of a\nhypermetropic eye.\nN’ = Near point of a\nnormal eye.\n\nScience\n\nThink it over\nYou talk of wondrous things you see,\nYou say the sun shines bright;\nI feel him warm, but how can he\nOr make it day or night?\n– C. CIBBER\nDo you know that our eyes can live even after our death? By donating our eyes after we\ndie, we can light the life of a blind person.\nAbout 35 million people in the developing world are blind and most of them can be\ncured. About 4.5 million people with corneal blindness can be cured through corneal\ntransplantation of donated eyes. Out of these 4.5 million, 60% are children below the\nage of 12. So, if we have got the gift of vision, why not pass it on to somebody who does\nnot have it? What do we have to keep in mind when eyes have to be donated?\n�\nEye donors can belong to any age group or sex. People who use spectacles, or those\noperated for cataract, can still donate the eyes. People who are diabetic, have\nhypertension, asthma patients and those without communicable diseases can also\ndonate eyes.\nweakening of the ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the\neye lens. Sometimes, a person may suffer from both myopia and\nhypermetropia. Such people often require bi-focal lenses. A common\ntype of bi-focal lenses consists of both concave and convex lenses.\nThe upper portion consists of a concave lens. It facilitates distant\nvision. The lower part is a convex lens. It facilitates near vision.\nThese days, it is possible to correct the refractive defects with\ncontact lenses or through surgical interventions.\nU\nS\nI\nN\n?\n1.\nWhat is meant by power of accommodation of the eye?\n2.\nA person with a myopic eye cannot see objects beyond 1.2 m distinctly.\nWhat should be the type of the corrective lens used to restore proper\nvision?\n3.\nWhat is the far point and near point of the human eye with normal\nvision?\n4.\nA student has difficulty reading the blackboard while sitting in the last\nrow.

For parallel refracting surfaces, as in a glass slab, the emergent ray\nis parallel to the incident ray. However, it is slightly displaced laterally.\nHow would light get refracted through a transparent prism? Cconsider a\ntriangular glass prism. It has two triangular bases and three rectangular\nlateral surfaces. These surfaces are inclined to each other. The angle\nbetween its two lateral faces is called the angle of the prism. Let us now\ndo an activity to study the refraction of light through a triangular glass\nprism.\n�\nEyes must be removed within 4-6 hours after death. Inform the nearest eye bank\nimmediately.\n�\nThe eye bank team will remove the eyes at the home of the deceased or at a hospital.\n�\nEye removal takes only 10-15 minutes. It is a simple process and does not lead to\nany disfigurement.\n�\nPersons who were infected with or died because of AIDS, Hepatitis B or C, rabies,\nacute leukaemia, tetanus, cholera, meningitis or encephalitis cannot donate eyes.\nAn eye bank collects, evaluates and distributes the donated eyes. All eyes donated are\nevaluated using strict medical standards. Those donated eyes found unsuitable for\ntransplantation are used for valuable research and medical education. The identities\nof both the donor and the recipient remain confidential.\nOne pair of eyes gives vision to up to FOUR CORNEAL BLIND PEOPLE.\n\n\nScience\n\nactivity and measure it.\n10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL\n10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL\n10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL\n10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL\n10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GLASS PRISM\nASS PRISM\nASS PRISM\nASS PRISM\nASS PRISM\nYou must have seen and appreciated the spectacular colours in a rainbow.\nHow could the white light of the Sun give us various colours of the\nrainbow? Before we take up this 10.4\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Refraction of light through a triangular glass prism\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colourful World\n\nThe prism has probably split the incident\nwhite light into a band of colours. Note the\ncolours that appear at the two ends of the\ncolour band. What is the sequence of colours\nthat you see on the screen? The various\ncolours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green,\nYellow, Orange and Red, as shown in\na figure. The acronym VIBGYOR will help\nyou to remember the sequence of colours.\nThe band of the coloured components of a\nlight beam is called its spectrum. You might\nnot be able to see all the colours separately.\nYet something makes each colour distinct from the other. The splitting\nof light into its component colours is called dispersion.\nYou have seen that white light is dispersed\ninto its seven-colour components by a prism.\nWhy do we get these colours? Different colours\nof light bend through different angles with\nrespect to the incident ray, as they pass\nthrough a prism. The red light bends the least\nwhile the violet the most. Thus the rays of each\ncolour emerge along different paths and thus\nbecome distinct. It is the band of distinct\ncolours that we see in a spectrum.\nIsaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain\nthe spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of\nthe spectrum of white light further by using another similar\nprism. However, he could not get any more colours. He\nthen placed a second identical prism in an inverted position\nwith respect to the first prism, as shown in a figure. This\nallowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through\nthe second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging\nfrom the other side of the second prism. This observation\ngave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven\ncolours.\nAny light that gives a spectrum similar to that of\nsunlight is often referred to as white light.\nA rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky\nafter a rain shower (a figure). It is caused by dispersion\nof sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the\natmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction\nopposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act like\nsmall prisms. They refract and disperse the incident\nsunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it\nagain when it comes out of the raindrop (a figure). Due\nto the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different\ncolours reach the observer’s eye.\nYou can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when\nyou look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water\nfountain, with the Sun behind you.\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Dispersion of white light by the glass prism\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Recombination of the spectrum of\nwhite light\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Rainbow in the sky\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Rainbow formation\nSunlight\nRaindrop\n\nScience\n\nSummary paragraph:", "prompt_sanitized": "Summarize this NCERT chapter in ONE dense paragraph of 400-500 words.\n\nBook: Class10Science | Chapter: CH10\n\nSTRICT FORMAT:\n- Write as ONE continuous paragraph (no sections, headers, or bullets)\n- Direct factual content - NO meta-commentary like \"this chapter covers\" or \"students will learn\"\n- Cover: core concepts, main topics, key definitions\n- Skip: specific examples, activities, exercises, questions\n- Dense style: every sentence adds new information\n\nWRITE DIRECTLY - Start with the content, not commentary.\n\nChapter text:\nThe Human Eye and\nthe Colourful World\n\nCHAPTER\nou have studied in the previous chapter about refraction of light by\nlenses.

Fischer\n\nScience\n\n\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations\n\n1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation\nIs there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?\nChemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\nchemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and\nmagnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –\nMg + O2 → MgO\n(1.2)\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the\nLHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the\nsame on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,\nthen the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on\nboth sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the burning of magnesium in air.\n1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.\nIn other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.\nThe word-equation for \n\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.\nLet us try to balance the following chemical equation –\nFe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.4)\n\nScience\n\nStep I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each\nformula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the\nequation.\nFe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.5)\nStep II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the\nunbalanced equation (1.5).\nElement\nNumber of atoms\nNumber of atoms\nin reactants (LHS)\nin products (RHS)\n\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we\ncannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the\nreactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient\n‘4’ as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation\nbecomes –\nFe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\nStep IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\nto proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced\nequation.\nTo equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules\nof hydrogen as four on the RHS.\nStep III: It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound\nthat contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a\nproduct. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum\nnumber of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe3O4 and the element\noxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on\nthe LHS.\nTo balance the oxygen atoms –\nThe equation would be –\nFe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + 4 H2\nAtoms of\nIn reactants\nIn products\noxygen\n(i)\nInitial\n1 (in H2O)\n4 (in Fe3O4)\n(ii)\nTo balance\n1×4\n\nAtoms of\nIn reactants\nIn products\nhydrogen\n(i)\nInitial\n8 (in 4 H2O)\n2 (in H2)\n(ii)\nTo balance\n\n2 × 4\n(1.6)\n(partly balanced equation)\n(1.7)\n(partly balanced equation)\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations\n\nTo equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the LHS.\n3 Fe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + 4 H2\n(1.8)\nStep VI: Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we\ncount atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.\n3Fe + 4H2O → Fe3O4 + 4H2\nThe numbers of atoms of elements on both sides of Eq. (1.9) are\nequal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical\nequations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance\nthe equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.\nStep VII: Writing Symbols of Physical States\nWriting Symbols of Physical States\nWriting Symbols of Physical States\nWriting Symbols of Physical States\nWriting Symbols of Physical States Carefully examine\nthe above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about\nthe physical state of each reactant and product? No information has\nbeen given in this equation about their physical states.\nTo make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states\nof the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical\nformulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants\nand products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s),\nrespectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product\nis present as a solution in water.\nThe balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes\n3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)\n(1.10)\nNote that the symbol (g) is used with H2O to indicate that in this\nreaction water is used in the form of steam.\nUsually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless\nit is necessary to specify them.\nSometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,\ncatalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow\nin the equation. For example –\nCO(g) + 2H (g)\n\n340atm\nCH OH(l)\n\n\n→\n\n(1.11)\n6CO (aq)\n12H O(l)\nC H O (aq)\n6O\n\n+\n+\nSunlight\n Chlorophyll\n→\n\n\n(aq)\n+6H O(l)\n(1.12)\n(Glucose)\nUsing these steps, can you balance Eq. (1.2) given in the text earlier?\nStep V: Examine the above equation and pick up the third element\nwhich is not balanced. You find that only one element is left to be\nbalanced, that is, iron.\nAtoms of\nIn reactants\nIn products\niron\n(i)\nInitial\n1 (in Fe)\n3 (in Fe3O4)\n(ii)\nTo balance\n1×3\n\n(1.9)\n(balanced equation)\n\nScience\n\n1.2 TYPES OF CHEMIC\n1.2 TYPES OF CHEMIC\n1.2 TYPES OF CHEMIC\n1.2 TYPES OF CHEMIC\n1.2 TYPES OF CHEMICAL REA\nAL REA\nAL REA\nAL REA\nAL REACTIONS\nCTIONS\nCTIONS\nCTIONS\nCTIONS\nWe have learnt in Class IX that during a chemical reaction atoms of one\nelement do not change into those of another element.

This reaction is known as\ndisplacement reaction.\nOther examples of displacement reactions are\nZn(s) + CuSO4(aq) →\nZnSO4(aq) + Cu(s)\n(1.25)\n(Copper sulphate)\n(Zinc sulphate)\nPb(s) + CuCl2(aq) →\nPbCl2(aq) + Cu(s)\n(1.26)\n(Copper chloride)\n(Lead chloride)\nZinc and lead are more reactive elements than copper.

The reaction taking place is written as –\nNaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\nThe reaction between an acid and a base to give a salt and water is\nknown as a neutralisation reaction. In general, a neutralisation reaction\ncan be written as –\nBase + Acid → Salt + Water\n2.1.5 Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids\n\n\nScience\n\nNow write and balance the equation for the above reaction. Since\nmetallic oxides react with acids to give salts and water, similar to the\nreaction of a base with an acid, metallic oxides are said to be basic oxides.\n2.1.6 Reaction of a Non-metallic Oxide with Base\nYou saw the reaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide\n(lime water) in Activity to\ninvestigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic.\n\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nThe bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in a figure.\nBut you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct\nelectricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions.\nAcids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as Cl– in HCl, NO3\n– in\nHNO3, SO2–\n\nin H2SO4, CH3COO– in CH3COOH. Since the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties.\nRepeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity?\n2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution?\nDo acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this.\nActivity, what do\nyou infer about the acidic character of:\n(i)\ndry HCl gas\n(ii)\nHCl solution?\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Preparation of HCl gas\nThis experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced\nin the presence of water. The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water.\nHCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+).\nH+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water. Let us see\nwhat happens when a base is dissolved in water.\nNaOH(s)\nH O\n\n\n→\n Na+ (aq) + OH– (aq)\nNote to teachers: If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced\nthrough a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.\n\nScience\n\nKOH(s)\nK (aq)+OH (aq)\nH O\n\n+\n\n→\n\n–\nMg(OH)2(s)\nH O\n\n\n→\n Mg2+(aq)+2OH–(aq)\nBases generate hydroxide (OH–) ions in water. Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis.\nDo You\nKnow?\nAll bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?\nNow as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\n–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows –\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nH X + M OH → MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\n– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations.\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns.\nThe glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.\nMixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\nWe know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions.\nCan we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?\nCan we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\nA scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (a figure). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.\nU\nS\nI\nN\n?\n1.\nWhy do HCl, HNO3, etc., show acidic characters in aqueous solutions\nwhile solutions of compounds like alcohol and glucose do not show acidic\ncharacter?\n2.\nWhy does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity?\n3.\nWhy does dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper?\n4.\nWhile diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be\nadded to water and not water to the acid?\n5.\nHow is the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+) affected when a\nsolution of an acid is diluted?\n6.\nHow is the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH\n–) affected when excess\nbase is dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide?\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Variation of pH with the change in concentration of H+(aq) and OH–(aq) ions\n\nScience\n\n\n\nSaliva (before meal)\n\nSaliva (after meal)\n\nLemon juice\n\nColourless aerated\ndrink\n\nCarrot juice\n\nCoffee\n\nTomato juice\n\nTap water\n\n1M NaOH\n\n1M HCl\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nWhat is the pH of the soil in your backyard?\nPlants require a specific pH range for their healthy growth.

For example, NaCl and Na2SO4 belong to the\nfamily of sodium salts. Similarly, NaCl and KCl belong to the family\nof chloride salts. How many families can you identify among the\nsalts given in this Activity?\n2.4.2 pH of Salts\nActivity\nthat it is a neutral salt.\nSeawater contains many salts dissolved\nin it. Sodium chloride is separated from these\nsalts. Deposits of solid salt are also found in\nseveral parts of the world. These large crystals\nare often brown due to impurities. This is\ncalled rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed\nwhen seas of bygone ages dried up. Rock salt\nis mined like coal.\nYou must have heard about Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi March. Did\nyou know that sodium chloride was such an important symbol in our\nstruggle for freedom?\nTable 2.4\nSalt\nAcid used\nBase used\n\nScience\n\nCommon salt — A raw material for chemicals\nThe common salt thus obtained is an important raw material for various\nmaterials of daily use, such as sodium hydroxide, baking soda, washing\nsoda, bleaching powder and many more. Let us see how one substance\nis used for making all these different substances.\nSodium hydroxide\nWhen electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium\nchloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The\nprocess is called the chlor-alkali process because of the products formed–\nchlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.\n2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) ® 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)\nChlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode.\nSodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three\nproducts produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the\ndifferent uses of these products.\nBleaching powder\nYou have already come to know that chlorine is produced during the\nelectrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used\nfor the manufacture of bleaching powder. Bleaching powder is produced\nby the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]. Bleaching powder\nis represented as Ca(ClO)2, though the actual composition is quite\ncomplex.\n2Ca(OH)2 + 2Cl2 ® Ca(ClO)2 + CaCl2 + 2H2O\na figure Important products from the chlor-alkali process\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nBleaching powder is used –\n(i)\nfor bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry, for bleaching\nwood pulp in paper factories and for bleaching washed clothes\nin laundry;\n(ii)\nas an oxidising agent in many chemical industries; and\n(iii)\nto make drinking water free from germs.\nBaking soda\nThe baking soda is commonly used in the kitchen for making tasty crispy\npakoras, etc. Sometimes it is added for faster cooking. The chemical\nname of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO3). It is\nproduced using sodium chloride as one of the raw materials.\nNaCl + H O + CO\n+ NH\nNH Cl + NaHCO\n\n→\n(Ammonium (Sodium\nchloride)\nhydrogencarbonate)\nDid you check the pH of sodium hydrogencarbonate in \n\nScience\n\nWhat does 10H2O signify?

This means that the substance becomes more oxidized.\n* Reduction is when a substance loses oxygen or gains hydrogen during a reaction. This means that the substance becomes less oxidized.\n\nNow, let's talk about why the color of copper sulphate solution changes when an iron nail is dipped in it.\n\nWhen an iron nail is dipped in copper sulphate solution, a displacement reaction occurs. The iron nail displaces the copper ions from the copper sulphate solution, resulting in the formation of iron(II) sulphate and copper metal.\n\nThe chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nFe(s) + CuSO4(aq) → FeSO4(aq) + Cu(s)\n\nIn this reaction, iron (Fe) displaces copper (Cu) from the copper sulphate solution. Copper is more reactive than iron, so it gets oxidized and turns into copper metal.\n\nNow, let's talk about why the color of the iron nail changes after being dipped in the copper sulphate solution. When iron is exposed to air, it forms a layer of iron(II) oxide on its surface, which gives it a brownish color. This is because oxygen from the air reacts with the iron to form iron(II) oxide.\n\nSo, when the iron nail is dipped in the copper sulphate solution, the iron metal reacts with the oxygen in the air to form iron(II) oxide, which changes the color of the iron nail from its original grayish color to a brownish color.\n\nNow, let's get back to your question about the substance 'X' that is used for whitewashing and write the reaction of the substance 'X' named in (i) above with water.\n\nThe substance 'X' that is used for whitewashing is lead(II) oxide, also known as lead white. The chemical formula for lead(II) oxide is PbO2.\n\nWhen lead(II) oxide reacts with water, it forms a solution of lead(II) hydroxide and carbon dioxide gas:\n\nPbO2(s) + H2O(l) → Pb(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g)\n\nThis reaction is an example of a single displacement reaction, where lead(II) oxide displaces hydrogen ions from water to form lead(II) hydroxide.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things for you!

You have seen\nthat elements can be classified as metals or non-metals on the basis of\ntheir properties.\n� Think of some uses of metals and non-metals in your daily life.\n� What properties did you think of while categorising elements\nas metals or non-metals?\n� How are these properties related to the uses of these elements?\nLet us look at some of these properties in detail.\n3.1 PHYSIC\n3.1 PHYSIC\n3.1 PHYSIC\n3.1 PHYSIC\n3.1 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES\nAL PROPERTIES\nAL PROPERTIES\nAL PROPERTIES\nAL PROPERTIES\n3.1.1 Metals\nThe easiest way to start grouping substances is by comparing their\nphysical properties. Let us study this with the help of the following\nactivities. For performing Activities 3.1 to 3.6, collect the samples of\nfollowing metals – iron, copper, aluminium, magnesium, sodium, lead,\nzinc and any other metal that is easily available.\n\n\nScience\n\nYou will find that some metals can be beaten into thin sheets. This\nproperty is called malleability. Did you know that gold and silver are the\nmost malleable metals?\nActivity to find out the answer.\nactivity shows that metals are good conductors of heat\nand have high melting points. The best conductors of heat are silver and\ncopper. Lead and mercury are comparatively poor conductors of heat.\nDo metals also conduct electricity? Let us find out.\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nMetals are good\nconductors of heat.\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n\nYou must have seen that the wires that carry current\nin your homes have a coating of polyvinylchloride (PVC)\nor a rubber-like material. Why are electric wires coated\nwith such substances?\nWhat happens when metals strike a hard surface? Do they produce\na sound? The metals that produce a sound on striking a hard surface\nare said to be sonorous. Can you now say why school bells are made of\nmetals?\n3.1.2 Non-metals\nIn the previous Class you have learnt that there are very few non-metals\nas compared to metals. Some of the examples of non-metals are carbon,\nsulphur, iodine, oxygen, hydrogen, etc. The non-metals are either solids\nor gases except bromine which is a liquid.\nDo non-metals also have physical properties similar to that of metals?\nLet us find out.\n\n\nScience\n\npoints but gallium and caesium have very low melting points.\nThese two metals will melt if you keep them on your palm.\n(ii)\nIodine is a non-metal but it is lustrous.\n(iii)\nCarbon is a non-metal that can exist in different forms. Each\nform is called an allotrope. Diamond, an allotrope of carbon, is\nthe hardest natural substance known and has a very high melting\nand boiling point. Graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is a\nconductor of electricity.\n(iv)\nAlkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium) are so soft that they\ncan be cut with a knife. They have low densities and low melting\npoints.\nElements can be more clearly classified as metals and non-metals\non the basis of their chemical properties.\n\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n\n3.2.1 What happens when Metals are burnt in Air?\nYou have seen in Activity.\nactivity needs the teacher’s assistance.\nIt would be better if students wear eye protection.\n�\nHold any of the samples taken above with a pair of tongs and try\nburning over a flame. Repeat with the other metal samples.\n�\nCollect the product if formed.\n�\nLet the products and the metal surface cool down.\n�\nWhich metals burn easily?\n�\nWhat flame colour did you observe when the metal burnt?\n�\nHow does the metal surface appear after burning?\n�\nArrange the metals in the decreasing order of their reactivity\ntowards oxygen.\n�\nAre the products soluble in water?\nAlmost all metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxides.\nMetal + Oxygen → Metal oxide\nFor example, when copper is heated in air, it combines with oxygen\nto form copper(II) oxide, a black oxide.\n2Cu + O2 → 2CuO\n(Copper)\n(Copper(II) oxide)\nSimilarly, aluminium forms aluminium oxide.\n4Al\n+\n3O2 → 2Al2O3\n(Aluminium)\n(Aluminium oxide)\nRecall from Chapter 2, how copper oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid.\nWe have learnt that metal oxides are basic in nature. But some metal\noxides, such as aluminium oxide, zinc oxide show both acidic as well as\nbasic behaviour. Such metal oxides which react with both acids as well as\nbases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides.\nAluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids and bases –\nAl2O3 + 6HCl\n→\n2AlCl3\n+ 3H2O\nAl2O3 + 2NaOH\n→\n2NaAlO2 + H2O\n(Sodium\naluminate)\nMost metal oxides are insoluble in water but some of these dissolve\nin water to form alkalis. Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in\nwater to produce alkalis as follows –\nNa2O(s) + H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq)\nK2O(s)\n+ H2O(l) → 2KOH(aq)\n\nScience\n\nWe have observed in activity of\nzinc, iron, copper or lead. Let us see some more reactions to arrive at a\nconclusion about the order of reactivity of these metals.\n3.2.2 What happens when Metals react with Water?\nActivity needs the teacher’s assistance.\n�\nCollect the samples of the same metals as in activity with cold water.\n�\nDid any metal produce fire on water?\n�\nDoes any metal start floating after some time?\n�\nPut the metals that did not react with cold water in beakers\nhalf-filled with hot water.\n�\nFor the metals that did not react with hot water, arrange the\napparatus as shown in a figure and observe their reaction with steam.\n�\nWhich metals did not react even with steam?\n�\nArrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with water.\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n\nMetals react with water and produce a metal oxide and hydrogen\ngas. Metal oxides that are soluble in water dissolve in it to further form\nmetal hydroxide. But all metals do not react with water.\nMetal\n+ Water → Metal oxide + Hydrogen\nMetal oxide + Water → Metal hydroxide\nMetals like potassium and sodium react violently with cold water. In\ncase of sodium and potassium, the reaction is so violent and exothermic\nthat the evolved hydrogen immediately catches fire.\n2K(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2KOH(aq) + H2(g) + heat energy\n2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + heat energy\nThe reaction of calcium with water is less violent. The heat evolved is\nnot sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire.\nCa(s) + 2H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)\nCalcium starts floating because the bubbles of hydrogen gas formed\nstick to the surface of the metal.\nMagnesium does not react with cold water. It reacts with hot water\nto form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen. It also starts floating due\nto the bubbles of hydrogen gas sticking to its surface.\nMetals like aluminium, iron and zinc do not react either with cold or\nhot water. But they react with steam to form the metal oxide and hydrogen.\n2Al(s) + 3H2O(g) → Al2O3(s) + 3H2(g)\n3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)\nMetals such as lead, copper, silver and gold do not react with water at all.\n3.2.3 What happens when Metals react with Acids?\nYou have already learnt that metals react with acids to give a salt and\nhydrogen gas.\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Action of steam on a metal\n\nScience\n\nMetal + Dilute acid → Salt + Hydrogen\nBut do all metals react in the same manner? Let us find out.\nactivity with dilute\nacids.\nWrite equations for the reactions of magnesium, aluminium, zinc\nand iron with dilute hydrochloric acid.\nHydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal reacts with nitric acid. It is\nbecause HNO3 is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the H2 produced to\nwater and itself gets reduced to any of the nitrogen oxides (N2O, NO,\nNO2). But magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) react with very dilute\nHNO3 to evolve H2 gas.\nYou must have observed in activity decreases in the\norder Mg > Al > Zn > Fe. In the case of copper, no bubbles were seen and\nthe temperature also remained unchanged. This shows that copper does\nnot react with dilute HCl.\nDo You Know?\nAqua regia, (Latin for ‘royal water’) is a freshly prepared mixture of concentrated\nhydrochloric acid and concentrated nitric acid in the ratio of 3:1. It can dissolve\ngold, even though neither of these acids can do so alone. Aqua regia is a highly\ncorrosive, fuming liquid. It is one of the few reagents that is able to dissolve gold and\nplatinum.\n3.2.4 How do Metals react with Solutions of other Metal\nSalts?\n\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n\n�\nIn which test tube did you find that a reaction has occurred?\n�\nOn what basis can you say that a reaction has actually taken\nplace?\n�\nCan you correlate your observations for the Activities 3.9, 3.10\nand 3.11?\n�\nWrite a balanced chemical equation for the reaction that has taken\nplace.\n�\nName the type of reaction.\nReactive metals can displace less\nreactive metals from their compounds in\nsolution or molten form.\nWe have seen in the previous sections\nthat all metals are not equally reactive. We\nchecked the reactivity of various metals\nwith oxygen, water and acids. But all\nmetals do not react with these reagents.\nSo we were not able to put all the metal\nsamples we had collected in decreasing\norder of their reactivity. Displacement\nreactions studied in Chapter 1 give better\nevidence about the reactivity of metals. It\nis simple and easy if metal A displaces\nmetal B from its solution, it is more reactive than B.\nMetal A + Salt solution of B → Salt solution of A + Metal B\nWhich metal, copper or iron, is more reactive according to your\nobservations in activity Series\nThe reactivity series is a list of metals arranged in the order of their\ndecreasing activities. After performing displacement experiments\n(Activities 1.9 and 3.12), the following series, (Table 3.2) known as the\nreactivity or activity series has been developed.\nTable 3.2 Activity series : Relative reactivities of metals\nPotassium\nMost reactive\nSodium\nCalcium\nMagnesium\nAluminium\nZinc\nReactivity decreases\nIron\nLead\n[H]\n[Hydrogen]\nCopper\nMercury\nSilver\nGold\nLeast reactive\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nReaction of metals with\nsalt solutions\n\nScience\n\n?\nU\nS\nI\nN\n1.\nWhy is sodium kept immersed in kerosene oil?\n2.\nWrite equations for the reactions of\n(i) iron with steam\n(ii) calcium and potassium with water\n3.\nSamples of four metals A, B, C and D were taken and added to the\nfollowing solution one by one. The results obtained have been tabulated\nas follows.\n3.3 HOW DO MET\n3.3 HOW DO MET\n3.3 HOW DO MET\n3.3 HOW DO MET\n3.3 HOW DO METALS AND NON-MET\nALS AND NON-MET\nALS AND NON-MET\nALS AND NON-MET\nALS AND NON-METALS REA\nALS REA\nALS REA\nALS REA\nALS REACT?\nCT?\nCT?\nCT?\nCT?\nIn the above activities, you saw the reactions of metals with a number of\nreagents. Why do metals react in this manner? Let us recall what we\nlearnt about the electronic configuration of elements in Class IX. We\nlearnt that noble gases, which have a completely filled valence shell, show\nlittle chemical activity. We, therefore, explain the reactivity of elements\nas a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.\nLet us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and\nsome metals and non-metals.\nWe can see from Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electron in its\noutermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell\nnow becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus\nof this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has\nbecome 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation\nNa+. On the other hand chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell\nUse the Table above to answer the following \n\nMetals and Non-metals\n\nand it requires one more electron to complete its octet. If sodium and chlorine\nwere to react, the electron lost by sodium could be taken up by chlorine.\nAfter gaining an electron, the chlorine atom gets a unit negative charge,\nbecause its nucleus has 17 protons and there are 18 electrons in its K, L\nand M shells. This gives us a chloride anion C1–. So both these elements\ncan have a give-and-take relation between them as follows (a figure).\nNa + e\n2,8,1\n2,8\n+\n(Sodium cation)\n→\n–\n+e\n2,8,7\n2,8,8\n(Chloride anion)\n–\n–\n→\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Formation of sodium chloride\nSodium and chloride ions, being oppositely charged, attract each\nother and are held by strong electrostatic forces of attraction to exist as\nsodium chloride (NaCl). It should be noted that sodium chloride does\nnot exist as molecules but aggregates of oppositely charged ions.\nLet us see the formation of one more ionic compound, magnesium\nchloride (a figure).\nTable 3.3 Electronic configurations of some elements\nType of\nElement\nAtomic\nNumber of\nelement\nnumber\nelectrons in shells\nL\nN\nNoble gases\nHelium (He)\n\nNeon (Ne)\n\nArgon (Ar)\n\nMetals\nSodium (Na)\n\nMagnesium (Mg)\n\nAluminium (Al)\n\nPotassium (K)\n\nCalcium (Ca)\n\nNon-metals\nNitrogen (N)\n\nOxygen (O)\n\nFluorine (F)\n\nPhosphorus (P)\n\nSulphur (S)\n\nChlorine (Cl)\n\nScience\n\nMg\n2+\n(Magnesium cation)\n →\n\n+ 2\n2 8 2\n2 8\n–\n, ,\n,\n+e\n2,8,7\n2,8,8\n(Chloride anion)\n–\n–\n →\n\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Formation of magnesium chloride\nThe compounds formed in this manner by the transfer of electrons\nfrom a metal to a non-metal are known as ionic compounds or\nelectrovalent compounds.

Nor do atoms\ndisappear from the mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical\nreactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to\nproduce new substances. You will study about types of bonds formed\nbetween atoms in Chapters 3 and 4. 1.2.1 Combination Reaction\n\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations\n\nLet us discuss some more examples of combination reactions. (i)\nBurning of coal\nC(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)\n(1.15)\n(ii)\nFormation of water from H2(g) and O2(g)\n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l)\n(1.16)\nIn simple language we can say that when two or more substances\n(elements or compounds) combine to form a single product, the reactions\nare called combination reactions.\n\nChemical Reactions\nand Equations\n\nCHAPTER\nconsider the following situations of daily life and think what happens\nwhen –\n�\nmilk is left at room temperature during summers. �\nan iron tawa/pan/nail is left exposed to humid atmosphere. �\ngrapes get fermented. �\nfood is cooked. �\nfood gets digested in our body. �\nwe respire. In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial\nsubstance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical\nand chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical\nchange occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place. You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a\nchemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction\nhas taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to\nthese 1.1\nBurning of a magnesium ribbon in air and collection of magnesium\noxide in a watch-glass\nActivity needs\nthe teacher’s assistance. It\nwould be better if students\nwear suitable eyeglasses. �\nClean a magnesium ribbon\nabout 3-4 cm long by rubbing\nit with sandpaper. �\nHold it with a pair of tongs. Burn it using a spirit lamp or\nburner and collect the ash so\nformed in a watch-glass as\nshown in a figure.

Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\nchemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and\nmagnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –\nMg + O2 → MgO\n(1.2)\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the\nLHS and RHS of the arrow.
