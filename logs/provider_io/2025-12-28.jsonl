Let's consider the reaction of calcium oxide (CaO) with hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\nThe unbalanced equation is:\nCaO + HCl → CaCl2 + H2O\n\nTo balance this equation, we can start by balancing the calcium and chlorine atoms:\n\nCaO + HCl → CaCl2 + H2O\n1Ca + 1O + 1H + 1Cl → 1Ca + 2Cl + 2H + O\nSimplifying:\nO + H + Cl → 2Cl + 2H\n\nNow, let's add water molecules to the equation:\n\nCaO + HCl → CaCl2 + H2O\nO + H + Cl → 2Cl + 2H\nAdding 1H2O molecule on both sides:\nCaO + HCl → CaCl2 + 2H2O\n\nThe balanced equation is now:\nCaO + 2HCl → CaCl2 + 2H2O\n\nReturn JSON with EXACT schema:\n{\n  \"boredom\": {\"detected\": true/false, \"score\": 0.0, \"reasons\": [\"...\"]},\n  \"interventions\": [\n    {\"position\":\"inline\",\"type\":\"micro_quiz|choose_path|study_tip|hints\",\"content\":\"...\"},\n    {\"position\":\"ui\",\"type\":\"mcq\",\"mcq\":{\n      \"id\":\"optional\",\n      \"question\":\"...\",\n      \"options\":[{\"key\":\"A\",\"text\":\"...\"},{\"key\":\"B\",\"text\":\"...\"}],\n      \"answer_key\":\"A\",\n      \"explanation\":\"optional\"\n    }}\n  ]\n}\n\nGuidelines:\n- If boredom score >= 0.6 OR user seems stuck, return 2-4 interventions.\n- Otherwise return 1-2 interventions.\n- If HOTS level is \"hard\" and CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false, include one challenge question.", "prompt_sanitized": "You are the Engagement Agent for an NCERT AI Tutor.\n\nMission:\n- Append engagement interventions at the END of the answer (append-only).\n- Detect boredom/low engagement using Chat History + Question + Draft Answer.\n- ALWAYS return at least 1 intervention (even if boredom is low).\n- Generate interventions grounded using ONLY Draft Answer + Sources.\n- Add light gamification: self-score + streak.\n- Emojis are allowed (max 2 per intervention).\n\nHard rules:\n- Do NOT introduce new factual claims beyond Draft Answer and Sources.\n- Do NOT rewrite the Draft Answer.\n- Output MUST be valid JSON only (no markdown, no extra text).\n- Keep interventions concise and student-friendly.\n- If you output an MCQ, set position=\"ui\" (never inline).\n\nGrounding label rule (only applies if you produce a micro_quiz):\n- In the \"micro_quiz\" intervention content, the FIRST line MUST be exactly:\n  📌 Grounded from: chunk parent_2\n- If the line above is empty, omit the grounding line entirely (do not invent one).\n\nCritical UX rule (avoid conflicting CTAs):\n- The Draft Answer may already end with a \"Would you like to explore further?\" question.\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is true:\n  - Return EXACTLY ONE intervention of type \"choose_path\".\n  - Do NOT return a \"micro_quiz\" (avoid competing call-to-action).\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false:\n  - Ensure at least one intervention is \"micro_quiz\" and it includes:\n    - 2 questions\n    - self-score line (0/2, 1/2, 2/2)\n    - streak challenge line\n\nInputs:\nQuestion: Understanding how acids and bases interact with metals in a chemical reaction.\nHOTS level: None\nCTA_ALREADY_PRESENT: false\n\nGrounding label (use verbatim if non-empty):\n📌 Grounded from: chunk parent_2\n\nChat History (recent):\n[{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"🌙 Good evening, student_001!

If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nScience\n\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1 UNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERSTANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\n2.1.1 Acids and Bases in the Laboratory\n\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nWhich of these – vanilla, onion and clove, can be used as olfactory\nindicators on the basis of your observations?

Now, let's analyze the behavior of dry HCl gas and its solution.\n\nDry HCl gas is an acid because it contains hydrogen chloride (HCl) molecules, which can dissociate into hydrogen ions (H+) and chloride ions (Cl–) when exposed to water. When we mix dry HCl gas with water, the following reaction occurs:\n\nHCl(g) + H2O(l) → H3O+(aq) + Cl–\n\nThis shows that even in its gaseous state, HCl is an acid that can release hydrogen ions upon contact with water.\n\nOn the other hand, when we consider the solution of dry HCl gas, it's essential to note that the acidic properties arise from the presence of dissolved hydrogen ions (H+(aq)). In other words, the solution of HCl becomes acidic only after the HCl molecules dissociate into their constituent ions in the presence of water.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I would say that both dry HCl gas and its solution exhibit acidic characteristics due to the presence of hydrogen ions.", "duration_ms": 5619, "error": null}

Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution? Do acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this. Activity, what do\nyou infer about the acidic character of:\n(i)\ndry HCl gas\n(ii)\nHCl solution? a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Preparation of HCl gas\nThis experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced\nin the presence of water. The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water. HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+). H+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water.

Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis. Do You\nKnow? All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis? Now as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\n–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows –\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nH X + M OH → MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\n– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations. a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\n    User Question: \"What happens when acid meets a metal?\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.

If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nScience\n\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1 UNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERSTANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\n2.1.1 Acids and Bases in the Laboratory\n\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nWhich of these – vanilla, onion and clove, can be used as olfactory\nindicators on the basis of your observations?

If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations. a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\nScience\n\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1 UNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERSTANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\n2.1.1 Acids and Bases in the Laboratory\n\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nWhich of these – vanilla, onion and clove, can be used as olfactory\nindicators on the basis of your observations?

If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations. a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\n    User Question: \"yes\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.

Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution.

This reaction is represented by the equation:\n\nAcid + Metal → Salt + Hydrogen gas\n\nHowever, to answer your question directly, we need to look at the specific experiment described in the context, which involves zinc granules reacting with dilute acids like HCl, HNO3, and CH3COOH.\n\nWhen these acids react with metal (zinc), they displace hydrogen atoms from the acid as hydrogen gas. This process is known as a single displacement reaction or a substitution reaction.\n\nThe specific observations made during this experiment are:\n\n* On passing the carbon dioxide gas evolved through lime water, Ca(OH)2(aq) produces a white precipitate of calcium carbonate.\n* When zinc granules react with dilute acids like HCl, HNO3, and CH3COOH, they form salts and release hydrogen gas.\n\nThese observations suggest that when acids meet metals, the metal displaces hydrogen ions from the acid, forming a salt and releasing hydrogen gas. This is an example of a single displacement reaction.\n\nTherefore, to summarize: When acids meet metals, the acid's hydrogen ions are displaced by the metal, resulting in the formation of a salt and the release of hydrogen gas.\n\nReturn JSON with EXACT schema:\n{\n  \"boredom\": {\"detected\": true/false, \"score\": 0.0, \"reasons\": [\"...\"]},\n  \"interventions\": [\n    {\"position\":\"inline\",\"type\":\"choose_path\",\"content\":\"...\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nSchema notes:\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is true: interventions MUST be exactly one choose_path (inline).\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false: interventions MUST be exactly two items:\n  1) {\"position\":\"ui\",\"type\":\"mcq\",\"mcq\":{\"id\":\"optional\",\"question\":\"...\",\"options\":[{\"key\":\"A\",\"text\":\"...\"},{\"key\":\"B\",\"text\":\"...\"}],\"answer_key\":\"A\",\"explanation\":\"optional\"}}\n  2) {\"position\":\"inline\",\"type\":\"micro_quiz\",\"content\":\"...\"}\n- Do NOT output study_tip or hints.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Always obey the Critical UX rule above (it overrides all other guidance).\n- If HOTS level is \"hard\" and CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false, make the MCQ a challenge question.\n- Keep the micro_quiz short and grounded; do not add any extra interventions beyond what the Critical UX rule allows.", "prompt_sanitized": "You are the Engagement Agent for an NCERT AI Tutor.\n\nMission:\n- Append engagement interventions at the END of the answer (append-only).\n- Detect boredom/low engagement using Chat History + Question + Draft Answer.\n- Generate interventions grounded using ONLY Draft Answer + Sources.\n- Add light gamification: self-score + streak.\n- Emojis are allowed (max 2 per intervention).\n\nHard rules:\n- Do NOT introduce new factual claims beyond Draft Answer and Sources.\n- Do NOT rewrite the Draft Answer.\n- Output MUST be valid JSON only (no markdown, no extra text).\n- Keep interventions concise and student-friendly.\n- If you output an MCQ, set position=\"ui\" (never inline).\n\nGrounding label rule (only applies if you produce a micro_quiz):\n- In the \"micro_quiz\" intervention content, the FIRST line MUST be exactly:\n  📌 Grounded from: chunk parent_2\n- If the line above is empty, omit the grounding line entirely (do not invent one).\n\nCritical UX rule (avoid conflicting CTAs):\n- The Draft Answer may already end with a \"Would you like to explore further?\" question.\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is true:\n  - Return EXACTLY ONE intervention of type \"choose_path\".\n  - Do NOT return a \"micro_quiz\" or \"mcq\".\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false:\n  - Return EXACTLY 2 interventions:\n    1) Exactly ONE intervention of type \"mcq\" with position=\"ui\" (never inline).\n    2) Exactly ONE intervention of type \"micro_quiz\" with position=\"inline\" that includes:\n       - 2 questions\n       - self-score line (0/2, 1/2, 2/2)\n       - streak challenge line\n  - Do NOT return \"choose_path\" in this case.\n\nInputs:\nQuestion: What happens when acids meet metals?\nHOTS level: None\nCTA_ALREADY_PRESENT: false\n\nGrounding label (use verbatim if non-empty):\n📌 Grounded from: chunk parent_2\n\nChat History (recent):\n[{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"🌙 Good evening student_001!
