Metals like potassium and sodium react violently with cold water, producing hydrogen gas, whereas calcium reacts less violently, causing the metal to float due to the formation of bubbles on its surface.

These processes are known as life processes, which require energy from outside sources, such as food, to maintain the organization of molecules within the body. The process of acquiring oxygen from outside the body and using it in cellular respiration is called respiration. In single-celled organisms, nutrients can be taken in through the entire surface, but in multi-cellular organisms, specialized tissues are needed for uptake, transportation, and excretion.

There, we had started with\na notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of\nthese movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed\ngerminates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the\ncourse of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth\nwere to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud – these are not movements caused by growth.\nWhy do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse. Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better.

This concept is closely linked to the notion that visible movements in organisms are often a response to changes in their environment, such as running away from predators or reaching towards sunlight. The nervous system, comprising specialized tissues like nerve cells and muscle tissue, plays a crucial role in controlling and coordinating these responses. In animals, reflex actions are rapid, automatic responses to stimuli, while voluntary actions require conscious thought and decision-making. The brain, with its fore-brain, mid-brain, and hind-brain regions, integrates sensory information, processes it, and sends signals to muscles for action. In contrast, plants have evolved alternative mechanisms for responding to stimuli, such as the sensitive plant's ability to fold up its leaves in response to touch, or directional growth that appears as movement.

If body\ndesigns are to be similar, the blueprints for these designs should be\nsimilar. Thus, reproduction at its most basic level will involve making\ncopies of the blueprints of body design. In Class IX, we learnt that the\nchromosomes in the nucleus of a cell contain information for inheritance\nof features from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo\nNucleic Acid) molecules. The DNA in the cell nucleus is the information\nsource for making proteins. If the information is changed, different\nproteins will be made. Different proteins will eventually lead to altered\nbody designs.\nTherefore, a basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA\ncopy. Cells use chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA.

However, these copies cannot simply be pushed out as separate cells, as they would lack the necessary cellular structure to maintain life processes. Instead, the cell divides to give rise to two cells, which are similar but not necessarily identical. This process is crucial for maintaining body design features and ensuring the survival of species in changing environments. Variation within populations is beneficial for species survival, as it allows some individuals to adapt to new conditions. Organisms can reproduce asexually through mechanisms such as binary fission, budding, or vegetative propagation, which create new individuals from a single parent.

Mendel found that certain traits, such as tallness and round seeds, followed specific patterns of inheritance, including dominance and recombination. He demonstrated that the tall/short trait and the round seed/wrinkled seed trait are independently inherited, meaning that each trait is determined by a separate gene set.
