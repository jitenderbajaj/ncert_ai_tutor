Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the burning of magnesium in air. 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants. In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step. The word-equation for \n\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation. Let us try to balance the following chemical equation –\nFe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.4)\n\nScience\n\nStep I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each\nformula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the\nequation. Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.5)\nStep II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the\nunbalanced equation (1.5). Element\nNumber of atoms\nNumber of atoms\nin reactants (LHS)\nin products (RHS)\n\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we\ncannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the\nreactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient\n‘4’ as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation\nbecomes –\nFe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\nStep IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\nto proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced\nequation.
