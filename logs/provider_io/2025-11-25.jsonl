This process involves converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nAs stated in passage [1], \"Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in glucose.\" (Page 123)\n\nThis process occurs in specialized organelles called chloroplasts, which contain pigments such as chlorophyll that help absorb sunlight. The energy from sunlight is then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nFor example, when a plant absorbs water through its roots and carbon dioxide from the air, it uses energy from sunlight to convert these substances into glucose and oxygen. This process is essential for the survival of plants and ultimately supports life on Earth.\n\nIn summary", "duration_ms": 4584, "error": null}
