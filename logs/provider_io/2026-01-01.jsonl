If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nScience\n\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1 UNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERSTANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\n2.1.1 Acids and Bases in the Laboratory\n\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nWhich of these – vanilla, onion and clove, can be used as olfactory\nindicators on the basis of your observations?

The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution.

It has a sour taste and can help neutralize stomach acid, which may provide relief from heartburn or indigestion.\n2. **Vinegar**: Vinegar is also an acid, with a pH of around 2.4. Its acidity can help counterbalance the excess acid in the stomach, potentially providing quick relief.\n3. **Baking Soda Solution (NaHCO3)**: Baking soda is a base (alkaline substance) with a pH of approximately 8.3-9.5. When dissolved in water, it forms a solution that can help neutralize stomach acid and provide relief from heartburn.\n\nConsidering the properties of these substances, I would think about the ability of acids to nullify each other's effects when choosing a remedy.

It has a sour taste and can help neutralize stomach acid, which may provide relief from heartburn or indigestion.\n2. **Vinegar**: Vinegar is also an acid, with a pH of around 2.4. Its acidity can help counterbalance the excess acid in the stomach, potentially providing quick relief.\n3. **Baking Soda Solution (NaHCO3)**: Baking soda is a base (alkaline substance) with a pH of approximately 8.3-9.5. When dissolved in water, it forms a solution that can help neutralize stomach acid and provide relief from heartburn.\n\nConsidering the properties of these substances, I would think about the ability of acids to nullify each other's effects when choosing a remedy. In this case, all three options have acidic or basic properties, but they work in different ways:\n\n* Lemon juice and vinegar are both acids that can help neutralize stomach acid.\n* Baking soda solution is an alkaline substance that can help counterbalance excess acid.\n\nBy considering the acidity and basicity of these substances, you might choose a remedy based on your knowledge of how acids interact with each other.\n\nReturn JSON with EXACT schema:\n{\n  \"boredom\": {\"detected\": true/false, \"score\": 0.0, \"reasons\": [\"...\"]},\n  \"interventions\": [\n    {\"position\":\"inline\",\"type\":\"choose_path\",\"content\":\"...\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nSchema notes:\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is true: interventions MUST be exactly one choose_path (inline).\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false: interventions MUST be exactly two items:\n  1) {\"position\":\"ui\",\"type\":\"mcq\",\"mcq\":{\"id\":\"optional\",\"question\":\"...\",\"options\":[{\"key\":\"A\",\"text\":\"...\"},{\"key\":\"B\",\"text\":\"...\"}],\"answer_key\":\"A\",\"explanation\":\"optional\"}}\n  2) {\"position\":\"inline\",\"type\":\"micro_quiz\",\"content\":\"...\"}\n- Do NOT output study_tip or hints.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Always obey the Critical UX rule above (it overrides all other guidance).\n- If HOTS level is \"hard\" and CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false, make the MCQ a challenge question.\n- Keep the micro_quiz short and grounded; do not add any extra interventions beyond what the Critical UX rule allows.", "prompt_sanitized": "You are the Engagement Agent for an NCERT AI Tutor.\n\nMission:\n- Append engagement interventions at the END of the answer (append-only).\n- Detect boredom/low engagement using Chat History + Question + Draft Answer.\n- Generate interventions grounded using ONLY Draft Answer + Sources.\n- Add light gamification: self-score + streak.\n- Emojis are allowed (max 2 per intervention).\n\nHard rules:\n- Do NOT introduce new factual claims beyond Draft Answer and Sources.\n- Do NOT rewrite the Draft Answer.\n- Output MUST be valid JSON only (no markdown, no extra text).\n- Keep interventions concise and student-friendly.\n- If you output an MCQ, set position=\"ui\" (never inline).\n\nGrounding label rule (only applies if you produce a micro_quiz):\n- In the \"micro_quiz\" intervention content, the FIRST line MUST be exactly:\n  📌 Grounded from: chunk parent_3\n- If the line above is empty, omit the grounding line entirely (do not invent one).\n\nCritical UX rule (avoid conflicting CTAs):\n- The Draft Answer may already end with a \"Would you like to explore further?\" question.\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is true:\n  - Return EXACTLY ONE intervention of type \"choose_path\".\n  - Do NOT return a \"micro_quiz\" or \"mcq\".\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false:\n  - Return EXACTLY 2 interventions:\n    1) Exactly ONE intervention of type \"mcq\" with position=\"ui\" (never inline).\n    2) Exactly ONE intervention of type \"micro_quiz\" with position=\"inline\" that includes:\n       - 2 questions\n       - self-score line (0/2, 1/2, 2/2)\n       - streak challenge line\n  - Do NOT return \"choose_path\" in this case.\n\nInputs:\nQuestion: What are the properties and behaviors of Acids and Bases in chemistry?\nHOTS level: None\nCTA_ALREADY_PRESENT: false\n\nGrounding label (use verbatim if non-empty):\n📌 Grounded from: chunk parent_3\n\nChat History (recent):\n[{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"🌙 Good evening, student_001!
