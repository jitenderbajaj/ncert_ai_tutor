Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis. Do You\nKnow? All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis? Now as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\n–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows –\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nH X + M OH → MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\n– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\n\nAcids, Bases\nand Salts\n\nCHAPTER\nou have learnt in your previous classes that the sour and bitter\ntastes of food are due to acids and bases, respectively, present in them. If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations. a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted. Acids, Bases and Salts\n\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS? 2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS? 2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS? 2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS? 2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS? We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\n    User Question: \"yes\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.

In this chapter, we shall be studying how various\ncomponents in the environment interact with each other and how we\nimpact the environment.\n13.1 ECO\n13.1 ECO\n13.1 ECO\n13.1 ECO\n13.1 ECO-SYSTEM — WHA\n-SYSTEM — WHA\n-SYSTEM — WHA\n-SYSTEM — WHA\n-SYSTEM — WHAT ARE ITS COMPONENTS?\nT ARE ITS COMPONENTS?\nT ARE ITS COMPONENTS?\nT ARE ITS COMPONENTS?\nT ARE ITS COMPONENTS?\nAll organisms such as plants, animals, microorganisms and human\nbeings as well as the physical surroundings interact with each other\nand maintain a balance in nature. All the interacting organisms in an\narea together with the non-living constituents of the environment form\nan ecosystem. Thus, an ecosystem consists of biotic components\ncomprising living organisms and abiotic components comprising\nphysical factors like temperature, rainfall, wind, soil and minerals.\nFor example, if you visit a garden you will find different plants, such\nas grasses, trees; flower bearing plants like rose, jasmine, sunflower;\nand animals like frogs, insects and birds. All these living organisms\ninteract with each other and their growth, reproduction and other\nactivities are affected by the abiotic components of ecosystem. So a garden\nis an ecosystem. Other types of ecosystems are forests, ponds and lakes.\nThese are natural ecosystems while gardens and crop-fields are humanmade (artificial) ecosystems.\n�\nYou might have seen an aquarium. Let us try to design one.\n�\nWhat are the things that we need to keep in mind when we create\nan aquarium? The fish would need a free space for swimming (it\ncould be a large jar), water, oxygen and food.\n�\nWe can provide oxygen through an oxygen pump (aerator) and\nfish food which is available in the market.\n\nOur Environment\n\n�\nIf we add a few aquatic plants and animals it can become a selfsustaining system. Can you think how this happens? An aquarium\nis an example of a human-made ecosystem.\n�\nCan we leave the aquarium as such after we set it up? Why does\nit have to be cleaned once in a while? Do we have to clean ponds\nor lakes in the same manner? Why or why not?\nWe have seen in earlier classes that organisms can be grouped as\nproducers, consumers and decomposers according to the manner in\nwhich they obtain their sustenance from the environment. Let us recall\nwhat we have learnt through the self sustaining ecosystem created by\nus above. Which organisms can make organic compounds like sugar\nand starch from inorganic substances using the radiant energy of the\nSun in the presence of chlorophyll? All green plants and certain bacteria\nwhich can produce food by photosynthesis come under this category\nand are called the producers.\nOrganisms depend on the producers either directly or indirectly for\ntheir sustenance? These organisms which consume the food produced,\neither directly from producers or indirectly by feeding on other consumers\nare the consumers. Consumers can be classed variously as herbivores,\ncarnivores, omnivores and parasites. Can you give examples for each of\nthese categories of consumers?\n�\nImagine the situation where you do not clean the aquarium and\nsome fish and plants have died. Have you ever thought what\nhappens when an organism dies? The microorganisms, comprising\nbacteria and fungi, break-down the dead remains and waste\nproducts of organisms. These microorganisms are the decomposers\nas they break-down the complex organic substances into simple\ninorganic substances that go into the soil and are used up once\nmore by the plants. What will happen to the garbage, and dead\nanimals and plants in their absence? Will the natural replenishment\nof the soil take place, even if decomposers are not there?\n\n\nScience\n\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nTrophic levels\n13.1.1 Food Chains and Webs\nIn \n\nOur Environment\n\nFrom the energy flow diagram (a figure),\ntwo things become clear. Firstly, the flow of\nenergy is unidirectional. The energy that is\ncaptured by the autotrophs does not revert\nback to the solar input and the energy which\npasses to the herbivores does not come back\nto autotrophs. As it moves progressively\nthrough the various trophic levels it is no\nlonger available to the previous level.\nSecondly, the energy available at each trophic\nlevel gets diminished progressively due to loss\nof energy at each level.\nAnother interesting aspect of food chain\nis how unknowingly some harmful\nchemicals enter our bodies through the food\nchain. You have read in Class IX how water\ngets polluted. One of the reasons is the use of\nseveral pesticides and other chemicals to\nprotect our crops from diseases and pests.\nThese chemicals are either washed down into\nthe soil or into the water bodies. From the\nsoil, these are absorbed by the plants along\nwith water and minerals, and from the water\nbodies these are taken up by aquatic plants\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Diagram showing flow of energy in an ecosystem\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nFood web, consisting of\nmany food chains\n\nScience\n\n\n\nOur Environment\n\n\n\nOzone)\n+\n→\n(\nThe amount of ozone in the atmosphere began to drop sharply in\nthe 1980s. This decrease has been linked to synthetic chemicals like\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used as refrigerants and in fire\nextinguishers. In 1987, the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP) succeeded in forging an agreement to freeze CFC production at\n1986 levels. It is now mandatory for all the manufacturing companies\nto make CFC-free refrigerators throughout the world.\n�\nCollect waste material from your homes. This could include all\nthe waste generated during a day, like kitchen waste (spoilt food,\nvegetable peels, used tea leaves, milk packets and empty cartons),\nwaste paper, empty medicine bottles/strips/bubble packs, old and\ntorn clothes and broken footwear.\n�\nBury this material in a pit in the school garden or if there is no\nspace available, you can collect the material in an old bucket/\nflower pot and cover with at least 15 cm of soil.\n�\nKeep this material moist and observe at 15-day intervals.\n�\nWhat are the materials that remain unchanged over long periods\nof time?\n�\nWhat are the materials which change their form and structure\nover time?\n�\nOf these materials that are changed, which ones change the fastest?\n�\nFind out from the library, internet or newspaper reports, which\nchemicals are responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer.\n�\nFind out if the regulations put in place to control the emission of\nthese chemicals have succeeded in reducing the damage to the\nozone layer. Has the size of the hole in the ozone layer changed in\nrecent years?\n13.2.2 Managing the Garbage we Produce\nIn our daily activities, we generate a lot of material that are thrown\naway. What are some of these waste materials? What happens after we\nthrow them away? Let us perform an activity to find answers to these\n\n\nScience\n\nWe have seen in the chapter on ‘Life Processes’ that the food we eat is\ndigested by various enzymes in our body. Have you ever wondered why\nthe same enzyme does not break-down everything we eat? Enzymes are\nspecific in their action, specific enzymes are needed for the break-down\nof a particular substance. That is why we will not get any energy if we\ntry to eat coal! Because of this, many human-made materials like plastics\nwill not be broken down by the action of bacteria or other saprophytes.\nThese materials will be acted upon by physical processes like heat and\npressure, but under the ambient conditions found in our environment,\nthese persist for a long time.\nSubstances that are broken down by biological processes are said\nto be biodegradable. How many of the substances you buried were\nbiodegradable? Substances that are not broken down in this manner\nare said to be non-biodegradable. These substances may be inert and\nsimply persist in the environment for a long time or may harm the various\nmembers of the eco-system.\n\n\nOur Environment\n\n\n\nScience\n\n\n\nOur Environment\n\n(c)\nGoat, cow and elephant\n(d)\nGrass, fish and goat\n3.\nWhich of the following are environment-friendly practices?\n(a)\nCarrying cloth-bags to put purchases in while shopping\n(b)\nSwitching off unnecessary lights and fans\n(c)\nWalking to school instead of getting your mother to drop you on her scooter\n(d)\nAll of the above\n4.\nWhat will happen if we kill all the organisms in one trophic level?\n5.\nWill the impact of removing all the organisms in a trophic level be different for\ndifferent trophic levels? Can the organisms of any trophic level be removed without\ncausing any damage to the ecosystem?\n6.\nWhat is biological magnification? Will the levels of this magnification be different at\ndifferent levels of the ecosystem?\n7.\nWhat are the problems caused by the non-biodegradable wastes that we generate?\n8.\nIf all the waste we generate is biodegradable, will this have no impact on the\nenvironment?\n9.\nWhy is damage to the ozone layer a cause for concern?

The biotic components include living organisms like plants, animals, microorganisms, and humans, while the abiotic components are physical factors that affect their growth and activities. Producers, such as green plants and certain bacteria, obtain energy from sunlight through photosynthesis, while consumers depend on producers for sustenance, categorizing them into herbivores, carnivores, omnivores, and parasites. Decomposers like microorganisms break down dead remains and waste products into simple inorganic substances that can be reused by plants. The flow of energy in an ecosystem is unidirectional and diminishes progressively through trophic levels, with the loss of energy at each level affecting the previous one. Food chains and webs illustrate this concept, while food webs consist of multiple interconnected food chains. Human activities like pollution have led to the depletion of ozone layers due to synthetic chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons, which are being phased out through international agreements.

Therefore, it does not have an acidic character. It will remain a neutral substance.\n\n(ii) HCl solution: When HCl is dissolved in water, it dissociates into its constituent ions - H+ and Cl-. The presence of these ions indicates that the solution has an acidic character.\n\nReturn JSON with EXACT schema:\n{\n  \"boredom\": {\"detected\": true/false, \"score\": 0.0, \"reasons\": [\"...\"]},\n  \"interventions\": [\n    {\"position\":\"inline\",\"type\":\"choose_path\",\"content\":\"...\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nSchema notes:\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is true: interventions MUST be exactly one choose_path (inline).\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false: interventions MUST be exactly two items:\n  1) {\"position\":\"ui\",\"type\":\"mcq\",\"mcq\":{\"id\":\"optional\",\"question\":\"...\",\"options\":[{\"key\":\"A\",\"text\":\"...\"},{\"key\":\"B\",\"text\":\"...\"}],\"answer_key\":\"A\",\"explanation\":\"optional\"}}\n  2) {\"position\":\"inline\",\"type\":\"micro_quiz\",\"content\":\"...\"}\n- Do NOT output study_tip or hints.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Always obey the Critical UX rule above (it overrides all other guidance).\n- If HOTS level is \"hard\" and CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false, make the MCQ a challenge question.\n- Keep the micro_quiz short and grounded; do not add any extra interventions beyond what the Critical UX rule allows.", "prompt_sanitized": "You are the Engagement Agent for an NCERT AI Tutor.\n\nMission:\n- Append engagement interventions at the END of the answer (append-only).\n- Detect boredom/low engagement using Chat History + Question + Draft Answer.\n- Generate interventions grounded using ONLY Draft Answer + Sources.\n- Add light gamification: self-score + streak.\n- Emojis are allowed (max 2 per intervention).\n\nHard rules:\n- Do NOT introduce new factual claims beyond Draft Answer and Sources.\n- Do NOT rewrite the Draft Answer.\n- Output MUST be valid JSON only (no markdown, no extra text).\n- Keep interventions concise and student-friendly.\n- If you output an MCQ, set position=\"ui\" (never inline).\n\nGrounding label rule (only applies if you produce a micro_quiz):\n- In the \"micro_quiz\" intervention content, the FIRST line MUST be exactly:\n  📌 Grounded from: chunk parent_3\n- If the line above is empty, omit the grounding line entirely (do not invent one).\n\nCritical UX rule (avoid conflicting CTAs):\n- The Draft Answer may already end with a \"Would you like to explore further?\" question.\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is true:\n  - Return EXACTLY ONE intervention of type \"choose_path\".\n  - Do NOT return a \"micro_quiz\" or \"mcq\".\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false:\n  - Return EXACTLY 2 interventions:\n    1) Exactly ONE intervention of type \"mcq\" with position=\"ui\" (never inline).\n    2) Exactly ONE intervention of type \"micro_quiz\" with position=\"inline\" that includes:\n       - 2 questions\n       - self-score line (0/2, 1/2, 2/2)\n       - streak challenge line\n  - Do NOT return \"choose_path\" in this case.\n\nInputs:\nQuestion: What are the characteristics and properties of Acids and Bases?\nHOTS level: None\nCTA_ALREADY_PRESENT: false\n\nGrounding label (use verbatim if non-empty):\n📌 Grounded from: chunk parent_3\n\nChat History (recent):\n[{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"🌅 Good morning student_001!

What could be the other effects of electric\ncurrent? We know that an electric current-carrying wire behaves like a\nmagnet. Let us perform the following Activity to reinforce it.\n\n\nScience\n\n12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES\n12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES\n12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES\n12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES\n12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES\nWe are familiar with the fact that a compass needle gets deflected when\nbrought near a bar magnet. A compass needle is, in fact, a small bar\nmagnet. The ends of the compass needle point approximately towards\nnorth and south directions. The end pointing towards north is called north\nseeking or north pole. The other end that points towards south is called\nsouth seeking or south pole. Through various activities we have observed\nthat like poles repel, while unlike poles of magnets attract each other.\nU\nS\nI\nN\n?\n1.\nWhy does a compass needle get deflected when brought near\na bar magnet?\n\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current\n\nMagnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude.\nThe direction of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a\nnorth pole of the compass needle moves inside it. Therefore it is taken\nby convention that the field lines emerge from north pole and merge at\nthe south pole (note the arrows marked on the field lines in a figure).\nInside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its\nnorth pole. Thus the magnetic field lines are closed curves.\nThe relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of\ncloseness of the field lines. The field is stronger, that is, the force acting\non the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are\ncrowded (see a figure).\nNo two field-lines are found to cross each other. If they did, it would\nmean that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point\ntowards two directions, which is not possible.\n12.2\n12.2\n12.2\n12.2\n12.2\n\nMAGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT\nGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT\nGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT\nGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT\nGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT-----CCCCCARRYING\nARRYING\nARRYING\nARRYING\nARRYING\nCONDUCTOR\nCONDUCTOR\nCONDUCTOR\nCONDUCTOR\nCONDUCTOR\nIn activity in the\nfollowing way –\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nDrawing a magnetic field line with the help of a\ncompass needle\n�\nMark the position of two ends of the needle.\n�\nNow move the needle to a new position\nsuch that its south pole occupies the\nposition previously occupied by its north\npole.\n�\nIn this way, proceed step by step till you\nreach the south pole of the magnet as\nshown in a figure.\n�\nJoin the points marked on the paper by a\nsmooth curve. This curve represents\na field line.\n�\nRepeat the above procedure and draw as\nmany lines as you can. You will get a\npattern shown in a figure. These lines\nrepresent the magnetic field around the\nmagnet. These are known as magnetic\nfield lines.\n�\nObserve the deflection in the compass\nneedle as you move it along a field line.\nThe deflection increases as the needle is\nmoved towards the poles.\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nField lines around a bar magnet\n\nScience\n\n12.2.1 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a Straight\nConductor\nWhat determines the pattern of the magnetic field generated by a current\nthrough a conductor? Does the pattern depend on the shape of the\nconductor? We shall investigate this with an activity.\nWe shall first cconsider the pattern of the magnetic field around a\nstraight conductor carrying current.\n\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current\n\nWhat happens to the deflection of the compass needle placed at a\ngiven point if the current in the copper wire is changed? To see this, vary\nthe current in the wire. We find that the deflection in the needle also\nchanges. In fact, if the current is increased, the deflection also increases.\nIt indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given\npoint increases as the current through the wire increases.\nWhat happens to the deflection of the needle if the compass is moved\naway from the copper wire but the current through the wire remains the\nsame? To see this, now place the compass at a farther point from the\nconducting wire (say at point Q). What change do you observe? We see\nthat the deflection in the needle decreases. Thus the magnetic field\nproduced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance\nfrom it increases. From a figure, it can be noticed that the concentric\ncircles representing the magnetic field around a current-carrying straight\nwire become larger and larger as we move away from it.\n12.2.2 Right-Hand Thumb Rule\nA convenient way of finding the direction of magnetic field associated\nwith a current-carrying conductor is given in a figure.\n�\nConnect the copper wire vertically between the\npoints X and Y, as shown in a figure (a), in\nseries with the battery, a plug and key.\n�\nSprinkle some iron filings uniformly on the\ncardboard. (You may use a salt sprinkler for this\npurpose.)\n�\nKeep the variable of the rheostat at a fixed\nposition and note the current through the\nammeter.\n�\nClose the key so that a current flows through\nthe wire. Ensure that the copper wire placed\nbetween the points X and Y remains vertically\nstraight.\n�\nGently tap the cardboard a few times. Observe\nthe pattern of the iron filings. You would find\nthat the iron filings align themselves showing\na pattern of concentric circles around the\ncopper wire (a figure).\n�\nWhat do these concentric circles represent?\nThey represent the magnetic field lines.\n�\nHow can the direction of the magnetic field be\nfound? Place a compass at a point (say P) over\na circle. Observe the direction of the needle. The\ndirection of the north pole of the compass\nneedle would give the direction of the field lines\nproduced by the electric current through the\nstraight wire at point P. Show the direction by\nan arrow.\n�\nDoes the direction of magnetic field lines get\nreversed if the direction of current through the\nstraight copper wire is reversed? Check it.\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\n(a) A pattern of concentric circles indicating\nthe field lines of a magnetic field around a\nstraight conducting wire. The arrows in the\ncircles show the direction of the field lines.\n(b) A close up of the pattern obtained.\n(a)\n(b)\nVariable\nresistance\n\nScience\n\nImagine that you are holding a current-carrying straight\nconductor in your right hand such that the thumb points towards\nthe direction of current. Then your fingers will wrap around the\nconductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field, as\nshown in a figure. This is known as the right-hand thumb rule*.\nExample 12.1\nA current through a horizontal power line flows in east to west\ndirection. What is the direction of magnetic field at a point directly\nbelow it and at a point directly above it?\nSolution\nThe current is in the east-west direction. Applying the right-hand\nthumb rule, we get that the magnetic field (at any point below or\nabove the wire) turns clockwise in a plane perpendicular to the wire,\nwhen viewed from the east end, and anti-clockwise, when viewed\nfrom the west end.\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nRight-hand thumb rule\n* This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule. If we cconsider ourselves driving a\ncorkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of the rotation of\ncorkscrew is the direction of the magnetic field.\n12.2.3 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a\nCircular Loop\nWe have so far observed the pattern of the magnetic field lines\nproduced around a current-carrying straight wire. Suppose\nthis straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a\ncurrent is passed through it. How would the magnetic field\nlines look like? We know that the magnetic field produced\nby a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the\ndistance from it. Similarly at every point of a current-carrying\ncircular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic\nfield around it would become larger and larger as we move\naway from the wire (a figure). By the time we reach at the\ncentre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would\nappear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying\ncurrent would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as\nstraight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right\nhand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire\ncontributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction\nwithin the loop.\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nMagnetic field lines of the field\nproduced by a current-carrying\ncircular loop\n?\nU\nS\nI\nN\n1.\nDraw magnetic field lines around a bar magnet.\n2.\nList the properties of magnetic field lines.\n3.\nWhy don’t two magnetic field lines intersect each other?\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current\n\nWe know that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying\nwire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it.\nTherefore, if there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is\nn times as large as that produced by a single turn. This is because the\ncurrent in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due to\neach turn then just adds up.\n\n\nScience\n\n12.3\n12.3\n12.3\n12.3\n12.3 FORCE ON A CURRENT\nFORCE ON A CURRENT\nFORCE ON A CURRENT\nFORCE ON A CURRENT\nFORCE ON A CURRENT-----CCCCCARRYING CONDUCTOR\nARRYING CONDUCTOR\nARRYING CONDUCTOR\nARRYING CONDUCTOR\nARRYING CONDUCTOR\nIN A MAGNETIC FIELD\nIN A MAGNETIC FIELD\nIN A MAGNETIC FIELD\nIN A MAGNETIC FIELD\nIN A MAGNETIC FIELD\nWe have learnt that an electric current flowing through a conductor\nproduces a magnetic field. The field so produced exerts a force on a\nmagnet placed in the vicinity of the conductor. French scientist Andre\nMarie Ampere (1775–1836) suggested that the magnet must also exert\nan equal and opposite force on the current-carrying conductor. The force\ndue to a magnetic field acting on a current-carrying conductor can be\ndemonstrated through the following activity.\n3.\nChoose the correct option.\nThe magnetic field inside a long straight solenoid-carrying current\n(a)\nis zero.\n(b)\ndecreases as we move towards its end.\n(c)\nincreases as we move towards its end.\n(d)\nis the same at all points.\nactivity suggests that a\nforce is exerted on the current-carrying aluminium rod when it is placed\nin a magnetic field. It also suggests that the direction of force is also\nreversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed.\nNow change the direction of field to vertically downwards by\ninterchanging the two poles of the magnet. It is once again observed that\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current\n\nthe direction of force acting on the current-carrying rod gets reversed. It\nshows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the\ndirection of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments\nhave shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the magnitude\nof the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles\nto the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a\nsimple rule to find the direction of the force on the conductor.\nIn \n\nScience\n\n12.4 DOMESTIC ELECTRIC CIRCUITS\n12.4 DOMESTIC ELECTRIC CIRCUITS\n12.4 DOMESTIC ELECTRIC CIRCUITS\n12.4 DOMESTIC ELECTRIC CIRCUITS\n12.4 DOMESTIC ELECTRIC CIRCUITS\nIn our homes, we receive supply of electric power through a main supply\n(also called mains), either supported through overhead electric poles or\nby underground cables. One of the wires in this supply, usually with\nred insulation cover, is called live wire (or positive). Another wire, with\nblack insulation, is called neutral wire (or negative). In our country, the\npotential difference between the two is 220 V.\nAt the meter-board in the house, these wires pass into an electricity\nmeter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected\nto the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate\ncircuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of\n15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as\ngeysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for\nbulbs, fans, etc. The earth wire, which has insulation of green colour, is\nusually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house.\nThis is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that\nhave a metallic body, for example, electric press, toaster, table fan,\nrefrigerator, etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which\nprovides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it\nensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance\nkeeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe\nelectric shock.\n2.\nIn \n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current\n\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure A schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits\nU\nS\nI\nN\n?\na figure gives a schematic diagram of one of the common\ndomestic circuits. In each separate circuit, different appliances can be\nconnected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a\nseparate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order\nthat each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected\nparallel to each other.\nElectric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits. We\nhave already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous\nchapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the\nappliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur\nwhen the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This\noccurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the\nappliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly\nincreases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse\nprevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage\nby stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating\nthat takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit.\nOverloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply\nvoltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many\nappliances to a single socket.\n1.\nName two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and\nappliances.\n2.\nAn electric oven of 2 kW power rating is operated in a domestic electric\ncircuit (220 V) that has a current rating of 5 A.

If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nSince the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties. Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution? Do acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this.

The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water. HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+). H+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water. Let us see\nwhat happens when a base is dissolved in water.

Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis. Do You\nKnow? All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis? Now as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\n–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows –\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nH X + M OH → MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\n– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations. a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\nHigher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value. The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (a figure). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH. U\nS\nI\nN\n? 1.

I considered this property while suggesting a baking soda solution as a remedy.

I considered this property while suggesting a baking soda solution as a remedy. Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is a base that can help counteract the excess acid in the stomach by neutralizing it, thereby providing relief from acidity.\n\nTo explain this further, let me provide some context:\n\nWhen an acid like lemon juice or vinegar is consumed in excess, it can irritate the stomach and cause discomfort.

There, we had started with\na notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of\nthese movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed\ngerminates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the\ncourse of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth\nwere to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud – these are not movements caused by growth.\nWhy do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse. Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better. When bright light is focussed on\nour eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond\nto it with movement in order to protect ourselves.\nIf we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this\nmovement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each\nkind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement\nin response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper,\nrather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends\non the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement\nmust be connected to the recognition of various events in the\nenvironment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other\nwords, living organisms must use systems providing control and\ncoordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation\nin multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these\ncontrol and coordination activities.\n6.1\n6.1\n6.1\n6.1\n6.1 ANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nIn animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and\nmuscular tissues, which we have studied in Class IX. Touching a hot\n\nControl and Coordination\n\nobject is an urgent and dangerous\nsituation for us. We need to detect it,\nand respond to it. How do we detect that\nwe are touching a hot object? All\ninformation from our environment is\ndetected by the specialised tips of some\nnerve cells. These receptors are usually\nlocated in our sense organs, such as the\ninner ear, the nose, the tongue, and so\non. So gustatory receptors will detect taste\nwhile olfactory receptors will detect smell.\nThis information, acquired at the\nend of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell\n[a figure (a)], sets off a chemical reaction\nthat creates an electrical impulse. This\nimpulse travels from the dendrite to the\ncell body, and then along the axon to its\nend. At the end of the axon, the electrical\nimpulse sets off the release of some\nchemicals. These chemicals cross the\ngap, or synapse, and start a similar\nelectrical impulse in a dendrite of the next\nneuron. This is a general scheme of how\nnervous impulses travel in the body. A\nsimilar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to\nother cells, such as muscles cells or gland [a figure (b)].\nIt is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised\nnetwork of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting\ninformation via electrical impulses from one part of the body to another.\nLook at a figure (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where\ninformation is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an\nelectrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a\nchemical signal for onward transmission.\n\n\nScience\n\n6.1.1 What happens in Reflex Actions?\n‘Reflex’ is a word we use very commonly when we talk about some sudden\naction in response to something in the environment. We say ‘I jumped\nout of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the\nflame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’.\nWhat exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that\nwe do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control\nof our reactions. Yet these are situations where we are responding with\nsome action to changes in our environment. How is control and\ncoordination achieved in such situations?\nLet us cconsider this further. Take one of our examples. Touching a\nflame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any\nanimal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to\nthink consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt,\nand therefore move our hand. An important 6.2). Where should such reflex arc\nconnections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve?\nThe best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet\neach other. Nerves from all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal\ncord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord\nitself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain.\nOf course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking\nprocess of the brain is not fast enough. In fact many animals have very\nlittle or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is\nquite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning\nin the absence of true thought processes. However, even after complex\nneuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be\nmore efficient for quick responses.\n\nControl and Coordination\n\nCan you now trace the sequence of events which occur when a bright\nlight is focussed on your eyes?\n6.1.2 Human Brain\nIs reflex action the only function of the spinal cord? Obviously not, since\nwe know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves\nwhich supply information to think about. Thinking involves more\ncomplex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated\nin the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body. The\nbrain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system (a figure).\nThey receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it.\nWe also think about our actions. Writing, talking, moving a chair,\nclapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions\nwhich are based on deciding what to do next. So, the brain also has to\nsend messages to muscles. This is the second way in which the nervous\nsystem communicates with the muscles. The communication between\nthe central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated\nby the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising\nfrom the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain\nthus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking. As you\nwill expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different\nparts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs.\nThe brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,\nmid-brain and hind-brain.\nThe fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions\nwhich receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas\nof the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on. There\nare separate areas of association where this sensory information is\ninterpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors\nas well as with information that is already stored in the brain. Based on\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Reflex arc\n\nScience\n\nall this, a decision is made about how to respond and the information is\npassed on to the motor areas which control the movement of voluntary\nmuscles, for example, our leg muscles. However, certain sensations are\ndistinct from seeing or hearing, for example, how do we know that we\nhave eaten enough? The sensation of feeling full is because of a centre\nassociated with hunger, which is in a separate part of the fore-brain.\nStudy the labelled diagram of the human brain. We have seen that\nthe different parts have specific functions. Can we find out the function\nof each part?\nLet us look at the other use of the word ‘reflex’ that we have talked\nabout in the introduction. Our mouth waters when we see food we like\nwithout our meaning to. Our hearts beat without our thinking about it.\nIn fact, we cannot control these actions easily by thinking about them\neven if we wanted to. Do we have to think about or remember to breathe\nor digest food? So, in between the simple reflex actions like change in\nthe size of the pupil, and the thought out actions such as moving a\nchair, there is another set of muscle movements over which we do not\nhave any thinking control. Many of these involuntary actions are\ncontrolled by the mid-brain and hind-brain. All these involuntary actions\nincluding blood pressure, salivation and vomiting are controlled by the\nmedulla in the hind-brain.\nThink about activities like walking in a straight line, riding a bicycle,\npicking up a pencil. These are possible due to a part of the hind-brain\ncalled the cerebellum. It is responsible for precision of voluntary actions\nand maintaining the posture and balance of the body. Imagine what\nwould happen if each of these events failed to take place if we were not\nthinking about it.\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Human brain\n\nControl and Coordination\n\n6.1.3 How are these Tissues protected?\nA delicate organ like the brain, which is so important for a variety of\nactivities, needs to be carefully protected. For this, the body is designed\nso that the brain sits inside a bony box. Inside the box, the brain is\ncontained in a fluid-filled balloon which provides further shock\nabsorption. If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you\nwill feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or\nbackbone which protects the spinal cord.\n6.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action?\nSo far, we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects\ninformation, sends it around the body, processes information, makes\ndecisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for\naction. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,\nmuscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When\na nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How\ndoes a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular\nlevel is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they\nshorten. So the next 6.2 COORDINA\n6.2 COORDINA\n6.2 COORDINA\n6.2 COORDINA\n6.2 COORDINATION IN PL\nTION IN PL\nTION IN PL\nTION IN PL\nTION IN PLANTS\nANTS\nANTS\nANTS\nANTS\nAnimals have a nervous system for controlling and coordinating the\nactivities of the body. But plants have neither a nervous system nor\nmuscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves\nof a chhui-mui (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touch-me-not’ plant of the Mimosa\nfamily), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the\nroot goes down, the stem comes up into the air. What happens? Firstly,\nthe leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch.\n\nScience\n\nThere is no growth involved in this movement. On the other hand, the\ndirectional movement of a seedling is caused by growth. If it is prevented\nfrom growing, it will not show any movement. So plants show two different\ntypes of movement – one dependent on growth and the other independent\nof growth.\n6.2.1 Immediate Response to Stimulus\nLet us think about the first kind of movement, such as that of the sensitive\nplant. Since no growth is involved, the plant must actually move its leaves\nin response to touch. But there is no nervous tissue, nor any muscle\ntissue. How does the plant detect the touch, and how do the leaves move\nin response?\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure The sensitive plant\nIf we think about where exactly the plant is touched, and what part\nof the plant actually moves, it is apparent that movement happens at a\npoint different from the point of touch. So, information that a touch has\noccurred must be communicated. The plants also use electrical-chemical\nmeans to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals,\nthere is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information.\nFinally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for\nmovement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal\nmuscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water\nin them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing\nshapes (a figure).\n6.2.2 Movement Due to Growth\nSome plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means\nof tendrils. These tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in\ncontact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object\ndoes not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object.\nThis causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it.\nMore commonly, plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a\nparticular direction. Because this growth is directional, it appears as if\nthe plant is moving. Let us understand this type of movement with the\nhelp of an example.\n\nControl and Coordination\n\nSummary paragraph:", "prompt_sanitized": "Summarize this NCERT chapter in ONE dense paragraph of 400-500 words.\n\nBook: Class10Science | Chapter: CH6\n\nSTRICT FORMAT:\n- Write as ONE continuous paragraph (no sections, headers, or bullets)\n- Direct factual content - NO meta-commentary like \"this chapter covers\" or \"students will learn\"\n- Cover: core concepts, main topics, key definitions\n- Skip: specific examples, activities, exercises, questions\n- Dense style: every sentence adds new information\n\nWRITE DIRECTLY - Start with the content, not commentary.\n\nChapter text:\nScience\n\nControl and\nCoordination\n\nCHAPTER\nn the previous chapter, we looked at life processes involved in the\nmaintenance functions in living organisms.

This concept is closely linked to the notion that visible movements are often a response to changes in the environment, such as seeing a mouse or feeling pain from touching a hot object. The nervous system, comprising specialized tissues like nerve cells and muscle tissue, plays a crucial role in controlling and coordinating these responses. In animals, reflex actions are rapid and automatic responses to stimuli, while voluntary actions require conscious thought and decision-making. The brain acts as the main coordinating centre, integrating sensory information and sending messages to muscles for action. However, plants lack a nervous system and muscles, yet they can still respond to stimuli through electrical-chemical means and changes in cell shape. For example, the sensitive plant responds quickly to touch by moving its leaves, while some plants like peas climb up objects by growing in a particular direction. The coordination of these responses is essential for survival, and understanding control and coordination mechanisms is vital for appreciating the complexity of life processes in living organisms.", "duration_ms": 4797, "error": null}

If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nThus, the reaction of a metal with an acid can be summarised as –\nAcid + Metal → Salt + Hydrogen gas\nCan you now write the equations for the reactions you have observed? Activity are written as –\nTest tube A: Na CO\nHCl(aq)\nCl(aq)\nH O(l) + CO\n\n(s)\n(g)\n+\n→\n+\n\nTest tube B: NaHCO\nHCl(aq)\nCl(aq)\nH O(l) + CO\n\n(s)\n(g)\n+\n→\n+\nOn passing the carbon dioxide gas evolved through lime water,\nCa(OH)\nH O(l)\n\n(aq)\n(g)\nCaCO s\n\n+\n→\n+\n( )\n(Lime water)\n(White precipitate)\n� Place a few pieces of granulated zinc metal in a test tube. � Add 2 mL of sodium hydroxide solution and warm the contents\nof the test tube. � Repeat the rest of the steps as in \n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nActivity, we have observed that the effect of a base is\nnullified by an acid and vice-versa. The reaction taking place is written as –\nNaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\nThe reaction between an acid and a base to give a salt and water is\nknown as a neutralisation reaction. In general, a neutralisation reaction\ncan be written as –\nBase + Acid → Salt + Water\n2.1.5 Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids\n\n\nScience\n\nNow write and balance the equation for the above reaction. Since\nmetallic oxides react with acids to give salts and water, similar to the\nreaction of a base with an acid, metallic oxides are said to be basic oxides. 2.1.6 Reaction of a Non-metallic Oxide with Base\nYou saw the reaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide\n(lime water) in Activity to\ninvestigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic. Acids, Bases and Salts\n\nThe bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in a figure. But you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct\nelectricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions.

Acids produce hydrogen ions (H+), which are responsible for their acidic properties. Bases, on the other hand, produce hydroxide ions (OH-), which are responsible for their basic properties.\n\nIn the context of the provided passage, it is mentioned that acids produce H+(aq) and bases produce OH-(aq) in water solution. This is further supported by the reaction between NaOH(s) and HCl(aq), where sodium hydroxide reacts with hydrogen chloride to form sodium chloride (NaCl) and water.\n\nThe concept of neutralization reactions is also discussed, which involves the combination of an acid and a base to produce a salt and water. For example, the reaction between NaOH(aq) and HCl(aq) can be represented as: NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l).\n\nIt is also mentioned that acids have a sour taste and change the color of blue litmus to red, while bases have a bitter taste and change the color of red litmus to blue.\n\nTherefore, I would like to ask the student if they would like to explore this concept further by looking into the properties and reactions of acids and bases in more detail.\n\nReturn JSON with EXACT schema:\n{\n  \"boredom\": {\"detected\": true/false, \"score\": 0.0, \"reasons\": [\"...\"]},\n  \"interventions\": [\n    {\"position\":\"inline\",\"type\":\"choose_path\",\"content\":\"...\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nSchema notes:\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is true: interventions MUST be exactly one choose_path (inline).\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false: interventions MUST be exactly two items:\n  1) {\"position\":\"ui\",\"type\":\"mcq\",\"mcq\":{\"id\":\"optional\",\"question\":\"...\",\"options\":[{\"key\":\"A\",\"text\":\"...\"},{\"key\":\"B\",\"text\":\"...\"}],\"answer_key\":\"A\",\"explanation\":\"optional\"}}\n  2) {\"position\":\"inline\",\"type\":\"micro_quiz\",\"content\":\"...\"}\n- Do NOT output study_tip or hints.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Always obey the Critical UX rule above (it overrides all other guidance).\n- If HOTS level is \"hard\" and CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false, make the MCQ a challenge question.\n- Keep the micro_quiz short and grounded; do not add any extra interventions beyond what the Critical UX rule allows.", "prompt_sanitized": "You are the Engagement Agent for an NCERT AI Tutor.\n\nMission:\n- Append engagement interventions at the END of the answer (append-only).\n- Detect boredom/low engagement using Chat History + Question + Draft Answer.\n- Generate interventions grounded using ONLY Draft Answer + Sources.\n- Add light gamification: self-score + streak.\n- Emojis are allowed (max 2 per intervention).\n\nHard rules:\n- Do NOT introduce new factual claims beyond Draft Answer and Sources.\n- Do NOT rewrite the Draft Answer.\n- Output MUST be valid JSON only (no markdown, no extra text).\n- Keep interventions concise and student-friendly.\n- If you output an MCQ, set position=\"ui\" (never inline).\n\nGrounding label rule (only applies if you produce a micro_quiz):\n- In the \"micro_quiz\" intervention content, the FIRST line MUST be exactly:\n  📌 Grounded from: chunk parent_3\n- If the line above is empty, omit the grounding line entirely (do not invent one).\n\nCritical UX rule (avoid conflicting CTAs):\n- The Draft Answer may already end with a \"Would you like to explore further?\" question.\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is true:\n  - Return EXACTLY ONE intervention of type \"choose_path\".\n  - Do NOT return a \"micro_quiz\" or \"mcq\".\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false:\n  - Return EXACTLY 2 interventions:\n    1) Exactly ONE intervention of type \"mcq\" with position=\"ui\" (never inline).\n    2) Exactly ONE intervention of type \"micro_quiz\" with position=\"inline\" that includes:\n       - 2 questions\n       - self-score line (0/2, 1/2, 2/2)\n       - streak challenge line\n  - Do NOT return \"choose_path\" in this case.\n\nInputs:\nQuestion: What are the main reactions and interactions between Acids and Bases?\nHOTS level: None\nCTA_ALREADY_PRESENT: false\n\nGrounding label (use verbatim if non-empty):\n📌 Grounded from: chunk parent_3\n\nChat History (recent):\n[{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"☀️ Good afternoon student_001!

You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations. a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\nHigher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value. The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (a figure). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH. U\nS\nI\nN\n? 1.

The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water. HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+). H+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water.

Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?

If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nSince the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties. Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution? Do acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this.

Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+). H+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water.

Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis. Do You\nKnow? All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis? Now as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\n–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows –\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nH X + M OH → MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\n– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations. a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\n    User Question: \"yes\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.

Look\\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume.

The general equation for this reaction is:\n\nBase + Acid → Salt + Water\n\nHowever, since metallic oxides are basic in nature, the equation can be written as:\n\nMetallic Oxide + Acid → Salt + Water\n\nFor example, when calcium hydroxide (lime water) reacts with hydrochloric acid, it produces calcium chloride and water. The balanced equation for this reaction is:\n\nCa(OH)₂ + 2HCl → CaCl₂ + 2H₂O\n\nThis shows that metallic oxides react with acids to produce salts and water.\n\nAs a student, would you like to explore the topic of how acids and bases cancel out each other's effects further?\n\nReturn JSON with EXACT schema:\n{\n  \"boredom\": {\"detected\": true/false, \"score\": 0.0, \"reasons\": [\"...\"]},\n  \"interventions\": [\n    {\"position\":\"inline\",\"type\":\"choose_path\",\"content\":\"...\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nSchema notes:\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is true: interventions MUST be exactly one choose_path (inline).\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false: interventions MUST be exactly two items:\n  1) {\"position\":\"ui\",\"type\":\"mcq\",\"mcq\":{\"id\":\"optional\",\"question\":\"...\",\"options\":[{\"key\":\"A\",\"text\":\"...\"},{\"key\":\"B\",\"text\":\"...\"}],\"answer_key\":\"A\",\"explanation\":\"optional\"}}\n  2) {\"position\":\"inline\",\"type\":\"micro_quiz\",\"content\":\"...\"}\n- Do NOT output study_tip or hints.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Always obey the Critical UX rule above (it overrides all other guidance).\n- If HOTS level is \"hard\" and CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false, make the MCQ a challenge question.\n- Keep the micro_quiz short and grounded; do not add any extra interventions beyond what the Critical UX rule allows.", "prompt_sanitized": "You are the Engagement Agent for an NCERT AI Tutor.\n\nMission:\n- Append engagement interventions at the END of the answer (append-only).\n- Detect boredom/low engagement using Chat History + Question + Draft Answer.\n- Generate interventions grounded using ONLY Draft Answer + Sources.\n- Add light gamification: self-score + streak.\n- Emojis are allowed (max 2 per intervention).\n\nHard rules:\n- Do NOT introduce new factual claims beyond Draft Answer and Sources.\n- Do NOT rewrite the Draft Answer.\n- Output MUST be valid JSON only (no markdown, no extra text).\n- Keep interventions concise and student-friendly.\n- If you output an MCQ, set position=\"ui\" (never inline).\n\nGrounding label rule (only applies if you produce a micro_quiz):\n- In the \"micro_quiz\" intervention content, the FIRST line MUST be exactly:\n  📌 Grounded from: chunk parent_2\n- If the line above is empty, omit the grounding line entirely (do not invent one).\n\nCritical UX rule (avoid conflicting CTAs):\n- The Draft Answer may already end with a \"Would you like to explore further?\" question.\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is true:\n  - Return EXACTLY ONE intervention of type \"choose_path\".\n  - Do NOT return a \"micro_quiz\" or \"mcq\".\n- If CTA_ALREADY_PRESENT is false:\n  - Return EXACTLY 2 interventions:\n    1) Exactly ONE intervention of type \"mcq\" with position=\"ui\" (never inline).\n    2) Exactly ONE intervention of type \"micro_quiz\" with position=\"inline\" that includes:\n       - 2 questions\n       - self-score line (0/2, 1/2, 2/2)\n       - streak challenge line\n  - Do NOT return \"choose_path\" in this case.\n\nInputs:\nQuestion: What is acid-base titration?\nHOTS level: None\nCTA_ALREADY_PRESENT: false\n\nGrounding label (use verbatim if non-empty):\n📌 Grounded from: chunk parent_2\n\nChat History (recent):\n[{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"🌙 Good evening! \\\"Good evening to you, student_001!

Why do HCl, HNO3, etc., show acidic characters in aqueous solutions while solutions of compounds like alcohol and glucose do not show acidic character?**\n\nIn aqueous solutions, acids like HCl and HNO3 dissociate into their respective ions, such as H+ and NO3-. These ions increase the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution, which is a characteristic of an acid. On the other hand, compounds like alcohol and glucose do not dissociate significantly in water and therefore do not exhibit acidic properties.\n\n(see Figure 1: Variation of pH with change in H+ ion concentration)\n\n**2. Why does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity?**\n\nAn aqueous solution of an acid conducts electricity because the hydrogen ions (H+) present in the solution can move freely, carrying electrical charge with them. This movement of ions is known as conduction, and it allows the solution to conduct electricity.\n\n**3. Why does dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper?**\n\nDry HCl gas does not change the color of dry litmus paper because the acid is in its gaseous state and has not yet reacted with any substance to produce ions that can affect the pH of the solution. Litmus paper changes color in response to acidic or basic solutions, but it will only respond to a solution containing H+ ions.\n\n**4. While diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be added to water and not water to the acid?**\n\nWhen adding an acid to water, the resulting solution can become more concentrated as the acid dissolves in water, potentially increasing the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) and affecting the pH of the solution. However, if we add water to an acid, it will dilute the concentration of H+ ions, making the solution less acidic.\n\n**5. How is the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+) affected when a solution of an acid is diluted?**\n\nWhen a solution of an acid is diluted by adding more water, the resulting solution becomes less concentrated. As a result, the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+) decreases because there are fewer H+ ions available to dissociate and form hydronium ions.\n\n**6. How is the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH–) affected when excess base is dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide?**\n\nWhen excess base is dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide, it increases the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-). This is because the addition of more base (NaOH) increases the amount of OH- ions present in the solution.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore any of these topics further!", "duration_ms": 7168, "error": null}

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\nScience\n\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1 UNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERSTANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\n2.1.1 Acids and Bases in the Laboratory\n\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nWhich of these – vanilla, onion and clove, can be used as olfactory\nindicators on the basis of your observations?
