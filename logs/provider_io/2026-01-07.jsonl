Acids, Bases and Salts\n\nThe bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in a figure. But you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct\nelectricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions. Acids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as Cl– in HCl, NO3\n– in\nHNO3, SO2–\n\nin H2SO4, CH3COO– in CH3COOH.\n\nSince the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties. Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution? Do acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this. Activity, what do\nyou infer about the acidic character of:\n(i)\ndry HCl gas\n(ii)\nHCl solution? a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Preparation of HCl gas\nThis experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced\nin the presence of water. The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water. HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+). H+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water.

Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis. Do You\nKnow? All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis? Now as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\n–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows –\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nH X + M OH → MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\n– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations. a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\n    User Question: \"What happens when acid meets metal?\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.

Answer the student's question using ONLY the provided context.\n\n    Context:\n    Acids, Bases\nand Salts\n\nCHAPTER\nou have learnt in your previous classes that the sour and bitter\ntastes of food are due to acids and bases, respectively, present in them. If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nSince the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties. Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution? Do acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this.

Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+). H+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water.

Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?

Since\nmetallic oxides react with acids to give salts and water, similar to the\nreaction of a base with an acid, metallic oxides are said to be basic oxides.\n2.1.6 Reaction of a Non-metallic Oxide with Base\nYou saw the reaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide\n(lime water) in Activity to\ninvestigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic.\n\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nThe bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in a figure.\nBut you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct\nelectricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions.\nAcids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as Cl– in HCl, NO3\n– in\nHNO3, SO2–\n\nin H2SO4, CH3COO– in CH3COOH. Since the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties.\nRepeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity?\n2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution?\nDo acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this.\nActivity, what do\nyou infer about the acidic character of:\n(i)\ndry HCl gas\n(ii)\nHCl solution?\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Preparation of HCl gas\nThis experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced\nin the presence of water. The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water.\nHCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+).\nH+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water. Let us see\nwhat happens when a base is dissolved in water.\nNaOH(s)\nH O\n\n\n→\n Na+ (aq) + OH– (aq)\nNote to teachers: If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced\nthrough a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.\n\nScience\n\nKOH(s)\nK (aq)+OH (aq)\nH O\n\n+\n\n→\n\n–\nMg(OH)2(s)\nH O\n\n\n→\n Mg2+(aq)+2OH–(aq)\nBases generate hydroxide (OH–) ions in water. Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis.\nDo You\nKnow?\nAll bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?\nNow as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\n–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows –\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nH X + M OH → MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\n– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations.\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns.\nThe glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.\nMixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\nWe know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions.\nCan we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?\nCan we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\nA scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (a figure). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.\nU\nS\nI\nN\n?\n1.\nWhy do HCl, HNO3, etc., show acidic characters in aqueous solutions\nwhile solutions of compounds like alcohol and glucose do not show acidic\ncharacter?\n2.\nWhy does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity?\n3.\nWhy does dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper?\n4.\nWhile diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be\nadded to water and not water to the acid?\n5.\nHow is the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+) affected when a\nsolution of an acid is diluted?\n6.\nHow is the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH\n–) affected when excess\nbase is dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide?\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Variation of pH with the change in concentration of H+(aq) and OH–(aq) ions\n\nScience\n\n\n\nSaliva (before meal)\n\nSaliva (after meal)\n\nLemon juice\n\nColourless aerated\ndrink\n\nCarrot juice\n\nCoffee\n\nTomato juice\n\nTap water\n\n1M NaOH\n\n1M HCl\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nWhat is the pH of the soil in your backyard?\nPlants require a specific pH range for their healthy growth.

Let us understand more about their preparation,\nproperties and uses.\n2.4.1 Family of Salts\n\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\n�\nIdentify the acids and bases from which the above salts may be\nobtained.\n�\nSalts having the same positive or negative radicals are said to\nbelong to a family. For example, NaCl and Na2SO4 belong to the\nfamily of sodium salts. Similarly, NaCl and KCl belong to the family\nof chloride salts. How many families can you identify among the\nsalts given in this Activity?\n2.4.2 pH of Salts\nActivity\nthat it is a neutral salt.\nSeawater contains many salts dissolved\nin it. Sodium chloride is separated from these\nsalts. Deposits of solid salt are also found in\nseveral parts of the world. These large crystals\nare often brown due to impurities. This is\ncalled rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed\nwhen seas of bygone ages dried up. Rock salt\nis mined like coal.\nYou must have heard about Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi March. Did\nyou know that sodium chloride was such an important symbol in our\nstruggle for freedom?\nTable 2.4\nSalt\nAcid used\nBase used\n\nScience\n\nCommon salt — A raw material for chemicals\nThe common salt thus obtained is an important raw material for various\nmaterials of daily use, such as sodium hydroxide, baking soda, washing\nsoda, bleaching powder and many more. Let us see how one substance\nis used for making all these different substances.\nSodium hydroxide\nWhen electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium\nchloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The\nprocess is called the chlor-alkali process because of the products formed–\nchlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.\n2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) ® 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)\nChlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode.\nSodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three\nproducts produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the\ndifferent uses of these products.\nBleaching powder\nYou have already come to know that chlorine is produced during the\nelectrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used\nfor the manufacture of bleaching powder. Bleaching powder is produced\nby the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]. Bleaching powder\nis represented as Ca(ClO)2, though the actual composition is quite\ncomplex.\n2Ca(OH)2 + 2Cl2 ® Ca(ClO)2 + CaCl2 + 2H2O\na figure Important products from the chlor-alkali process\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nBleaching powder is used –\n(i)\nfor bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry, for bleaching\nwood pulp in paper factories and for bleaching washed clothes\nin laundry;\n(ii)\nas an oxidising agent in many chemical industries; and\n(iii)\nto make drinking water free from germs.\nBaking soda\nThe baking soda is commonly used in the kitchen for making tasty crispy\npakoras, etc. Sometimes it is added for faster cooking. The chemical\nname of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO3). It is\nproduced using sodium chloride as one of the raw materials.\nNaCl + H O + CO\n+ NH\nNH Cl + NaHCO\n\n→\n(Ammonium (Sodium\nchloride)\nhydrogencarbonate)\nDid you check the pH of sodium hydrogencarbonate in \n\nScience\n\nWhat does 10H2O signify?

Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.\nIn this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life.\nDo You Know?\nLitmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is comm\n\n[... truncated 13523 chars]", "output_length": 3368, "output": "Acids, bases, and salts are substances that exhibit sour or bitter tastes in food, change the color of litmus to red or blue, and can be used as indicators for acids and bases, with natural materials like lichen, red cabbage leaves, turmeric, and colored petals of flowers being used as acid-base indicators, these natural materials change their color when exposed to acidic or basic substances, allowing us to identify the presence of acids and bases in a solution.
