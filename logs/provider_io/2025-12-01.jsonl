A chemical equation represents a chemical reaction, which can be written as a word-equation or a skeletal chemical equation using chemical formulae instead of words. The law of conservation of mass states that mass cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction, meaning the total mass of elements present in products equals the total mass of elements present in reactants.
