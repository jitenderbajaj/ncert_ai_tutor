In a lab setting, one of the fundamental concepts to understand is how acids and bases react with metals. When an acid (such as HCl) reacts with zinc granules, it displaces hydrogen atoms from the acid, forming a salt and releasing hydrogen gas: Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂.\n\nIn contrast, when a base (like NaOH or KOH) reacts with zinc, it forms a salt and releases hydroxide ions. The reaction for this process is similar to that of acids but results in the formation of the hydroxide ion: Zn + 2NaOH → Zn(OH)₂ + 2NaCl.\n\nThis understanding highlights how acids produce hydrogen ions (H⁺), which are responsible for their acidic properties, while bases generate hydroxide ions (OH⁻), responsible for their basic properties. These fundamental reactions form the basis of neutralization and chemical analysis in a laboratory setting.\n\nFor an acid-base indicator like litmus or synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and phenolphthalein, one key aspect is that they change color based on whether the solution contains more H⁺ ions (acidic conditions) or OH⁻ ions (basic conditions), allowing us to determine if a substance is acidic or basic.\n\nUnderstanding the properties of acids and bases in a laboratory setting is crucial for chemical analysis, reaction identification, and safety protocols. By grasping how these substances interact with each other and their surroundings, chemists can perform experiments safely and accurately determine the nature of various compounds.\n\nThis fundamental knowledge helps us recognize acidity and basicity based on indicators, conduct experiments involving reactions between acids, bases, and metals, and ultimately understand chemical principles in a more comprehensive manner.", "duration_ms": 5995, "error": null}

Acids, Bases and Salts\n\nThe bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in a figure. But you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct\nelectricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions. Acids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as Cl– in HCl, NO3\n– in\nHNO3, SO2–\n\nin H2SO4, CH3COO– in CH3COOH.\n\nSince the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties. Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution? Do acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this. Activity, what do\nyou infer about the acidic character of:\n(i)\ndry HCl gas\n(ii)\nHCl solution? a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Preparation of HCl gas\nThis experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced\nin the presence of water. The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water. HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+). H+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water. Let us see\nwhat happens when a base is dissolved in water. NaOH(s)\nH O\n\n\n→\n Na+ (aq) + OH– (aq)\nNote to teachers: If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced\nthrough a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.

Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis. Do You\nKnow? All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis? Now as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\n–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows –\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nH X + M OH → MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\n– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\n\nAcids, Bases\nand Salts\n\nCHAPTER\nou have learnt in your previous classes that the sour and bitter\ntastes of food are due to acids and bases, respectively, present in them. If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\n    User Question: \"What are the key steps involved in a Neutralization Reaction?\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.

Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in a figure) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.\n\nScience\n\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1\n2.1 UNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERST\nUNDERSTANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMIC\nANDING THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nAL PROPERTIES OF\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\nACIDS AND BASES\n2.1.1 Acids and Bases in the Laboratory\n\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nWhich of these – vanilla, onion and clove, can be used as olfactory\nindicators on the basis of your observations?

The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (a figure). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH. U\nS\nI\nN\n? 1.

If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\nActivity with sodium hydroxide pellet\n\n[... truncated 7049 chars]", "output_length": 856, "output": "I'd be happy to help you with your question about acidity after overeating. \n\nTo alleviate acidity caused by eating too much, I would suggest lemon juice as a remedy. The property that comes to mind while choosing this remedy is the ability of acids and bases to neutralize each other's effects. Lemon juice contains citric acid, which can help counteract the excess acid in the stomach.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that vinegar could also be used as an alternative remedy, but lemon juice might be a better option since it doesn't have any alkaline properties that could worsen the acidity. Baking soda solution is not recommended because baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is a base and adding it to an acidic stomach can further irritate the esophagus and digestive tract.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like more information or clarification on this topic!", "duration_ms": 4227, "error": null}
