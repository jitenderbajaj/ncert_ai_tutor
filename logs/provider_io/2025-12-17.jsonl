For example, NaCl and Na2SO4 belong to the\nfamily of sodium salts. Similarly, NaCl and KCl belong to the family\nof chloride salts. How many families can you identify among the\nsalts given in this Activity? 2.4.2 pH of Salts\nActivity\nthat it is a neutral salt. Seawater contains many salts dissolved\nin it. Sodium chloride is separated from these\nsalts. Deposits of solid salt are also found in\nseveral parts of the world. These large crystals\nare often brown due to impurities. This is\ncalled rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed\nwhen seas of bygone ages dried up. Rock salt\nis mined like coal. You must have heard about Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi March. Did\nyou know that sodium chloride was such an important symbol in our\nstruggle for freedom? Table 2.4\nSalt\nAcid used\nBase used\n\nScience\n\nCommon salt — A raw material for chemicals\nThe common salt thus obtained is an important raw material for various\nmaterials of daily use, such as sodium hydroxide, baking soda, washing\nsoda, bleaching powder and many more. Let us see how one substance\nis used for making all these different substances. Sodium hydroxide\nWhen electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium\nchloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The\nprocess is called the chlor-alkali process because of the products formed–\nchlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide. 2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) ® 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)\nChlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode. Sodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three\nproducts produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the\ndifferent uses of these products. Bleaching powder\nYou have already come to know that chlorine is produced during the\nelectrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used\nfor the manufacture of bleaching powder. Bleaching powder is produced\nby the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2].\n\nHigher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value. The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (a figure). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH. U\nS\nI\nN\n? 1. Why do HCl, HNO3, etc., show acidic characters in aqueous solutions\nwhile solutions of compounds like alcohol and glucose do not show acidic\ncharacter? 2. Why does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity? 3. Why does dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper? 4. While diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be\nadded to water and not water to the acid? 5. How is the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+) affected when a\nsolution of an acid is diluted? 6. How is the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH\n–) affected when excess\nbase is dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide? a figure\na figure\na figure\na figure\na figure Variation of pH with the change in concentration of H+(aq) and OH–(aq) ions\n\nScience\n\n\n\nSaliva (before meal)\n\nSaliva (after meal)\n\nLemon juice\n\nColourless aerated\ndrink\n\nCarrot juice\n\nCoffee\n\nTomato juice\n\nTap water\n\n1M NaOH\n\n1M HCl\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nWhat is the pH of the soil in your backyard?

Let us understand more about their preparation,\nproperties and uses. 2.4.1 Family of Salts\n\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\n�\nIdentify the acids and bases from which the above salts may be\nobtained.\n\nAcids, Bases\nand Salts\n\nCHAPTER\nou have learnt in your previous classes that the sour and bitter\ntastes of food are due to acids and bases, respectively, present in them. If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? � Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. � Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. Do You Know? Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n\n    User Question: \"📖 Explain a key concept from the chapter\"\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. **ANALYZE CONTEXT TYPE:**\n       - **If the context is a Table of Contents (TOC) or List of Topics:** \n         Do NOT merely list the chapters.

Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution?

In this type of reaction, the acid donates a hydrogen ion (H+), while the base donates an hydroxide ion (OH-). This results in the formation of a neutral compound, known as a salt, and water.\n\nThe general equation for an acid-base reaction is:\n\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\n\nFor example, when hydrochloric acid (HCl) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), the following equation occurs:\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nIn this reaction, the hydrogen ion from the HCl donates to the hydroxide ion from the NaOH, forming water.
